There was so much snow that school was cancelled. It was a snow day! The Sharer Fam ran outside to play in the snow. The Sharer Bros made snow balls and had an epic snow ball fight and then hopped on their sleds and went down the hill. They walked up the hill just to sled back down. Liz and Carter even made a huge snowman. Liz put her hat and gloves on the snow man to keep him warm. The whole Sharer Fam was having so much fun they all made snow angles. After the long day of fun out in the snow the Sharer Fam drank hot chocolate out of Share the Love mugs in front of the fire place to warm up. If you thought this was the most epic vlog and music video ever then comment #MusicVideo and smash the like button.

Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do. It gives me the feels for sure.

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy (Out of my mind, out of my mind) Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me (Too many times, too many times) My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself One: Don't pick up the phone You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone Two: Don't let him in You'll have to kick him out again Three: Don't be his friend You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him I got new rules, I count 'em I got new rules, I count 'em I gotta tell them to myself I got new rules, I count 'em I gotta tell them to myself I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards (Nowhere to turn, no way) (Nowhere to turn, no) Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern (I never learn, I never learn) But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself I do, I do, I do One: Don't pick up the phone You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone Two: Don't let him in You'll have to kick him out again Three: Don't be his friend You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him I got new rules, I count 'em I got new rules, I count 'em I gotta tell them to myself I got new rules, I count 'em I gotta tell them to myself Practice makes perfect I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em) Eat, sleep, and breathe it Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... (I got new...) One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah) You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone) Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh) You'll have to kick him out again (again) Three: Don't be his friend You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him I got new rules, I count 'em I got new rules, I count 'em (Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa) I gotta tell them to myself I got new rules, I count 'em (Baby, you know I count 'em) I gotta tell them to myself Don't let him in, don't let him in Don't, don't, don't, don't...

What truths about the past await Elsa as she ventures into the unknown to the enchanted forests and dark seas beyond Arendelle? The answers are calling her but also threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll face a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough. From the Academy Award®-winning team—directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, producer Peter Del Vecho and songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez—and featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Frozen 2” opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. 22, 2019. 🍁🍂🍁🍂🍁🍂 Connect with Disney Music on: Instagram: https://instagram.com/disneymusic Facebook: https://facebook.com/disneymusic Twitter: https://twitter.com/disneymusic For more Frozen 2: Facebook: https://facebook.com/DisneyFrozen Twitter: https://twitter.com/DisneyFrozen IG: https://www.instagram.com/DisneyFrozen #Frozen2 #ShowYourself #IdinaMenzel Music video by Idina Menzel, AURORA performing Show Yourself (From "Frozen 2"). © 2019 Walt Disney Records FROZEN 2 Show Yourself Official Music Video DisneyMusicVEVO	10	Music	PT3M50S	230	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aiQbDk5V2yU/maxresdefault.jpg		1102939	13449	439	0	875
