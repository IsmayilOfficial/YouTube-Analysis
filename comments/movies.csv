fqF-3urweOk ,Its good if you fast forward it to the end!,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,this has to be the slowest movie i have ever seen. Its almost like its intentional!,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,exactly when does the ''thriller'' portion of the movie kick in?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,I feel like I am watching somebody's handi-cam vacation footage......,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Really... thriller movie!!!!!! OMG,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,So....the bad guys just up and disappeared? Is that where the title came from?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Slow and stupid movie. A waste of time.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,It should be awarded for the worest movie of all time,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,This film has a good first half and a crap conclusion. Joe is a wimp. Divorce him Jane!,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,I actually really enjoy slow build ups to horror and thrillers like this. The scenes in the car of there obviously failing relashionship we're very realistic in my view. No words can really speak volumes and I find this kind of build up my style and wish more thrillers Wernt action action action. This is a very low budget film which is obvious. But this is how they work on there craft. I was really enjoying untill they got out of the water with the 2 guys. That should of been a highlight .i thought they could of made it be something like a guy she had shagged. Or a guy he had once bullied absolutely anything but nothing!! Ha.and when they just got dressed and just sat there?? What not going to grab a bat a knife !! Silly Pros but the end very very bad,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,What the heck was that????? I don't understand anything in this movie,((,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"Ending sucked big time, I can't believe I wasted that much time for nothing.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,51 minutes in and it's just too awful to go any further. ,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,After seeing a camera for the seventh time I gave up on this !,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,the guy behind ...sorry for this thiller ..haha 34:33,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,The beginning there is too much TALKING and not ENOUGH action....,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Its getting too boring now.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Was that a camera man at 30.16?! lol....,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"i don't know about the wirters as of now, but the actors are darn good, maybe the movie will get to the thriller soon. i hope there is a happy ending. i see that the husband is really hurting inside and the wife is too.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Crappy movie. I thought it was a love story the first half. Then it turned into a bootleg Wrong turn movie....Wackkkkkk,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,at 30:34 crouching man behind Joe.lol,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,This is the most nothingess movie I have seen so far !  A total waste.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"Not a bad effort for a low/no budget independent film,  apart from the editing mistakes and lack of real story...the scenery was beautiful , atmospheric lake setting . I woild have liked this more if there was an interesting story and a better done end. ...but it had its moments. ",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"Ron, get me some coffee before I rip your  arm off!",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Skipped most of it.......,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Saw the ending.....I missed nothing. The advertisements were more captivating.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,simple basic thriller,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"What a waste of time, I think this is the slowest most boring movie I've seen. And what the hell was it about, I only watched to 25.00 bc I couldn't stand anymore. it's nothingness personified.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"well, that was pretty unsatisfactory",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Did you see the guy hiding in lower left at 34:33?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Was the female lead in this movie a lead character in 6 feet under?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,ok 36.33 mins in only thing I can see is bad camera angles keep your people out of the shot the lady has nice buns though.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,wish they made all movies with this camera guy I would not spend so much time in front of the TV this is no thriller its more of a comedy with this guy running the camera,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,I agree. whoever made this film needs encouragement not ridicule. hopefully the director will make more films. I loved the scenery very beautiful. I'm from England and we don't get peaceful places like that! well done enjoyed the film,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,boooring,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,stupid movie,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,I LO V E D I T!!! I loved how the circumstances gave this couple another chance. Lots of technical mishaps but the cinematography is beautiful and the acting very very good. Fell for Kit Pongetti! All your films are great : ) thank you so much,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Worst.movie.ever.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,The movie is too slow for me. I kept thinking Joe is bipolar or special needs. I kept falling asleep until the 41 minute mark. I enjoyed the movie afte that 41:38 ?,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"OMG! 30:17, the camera guy is in the shot, on the right side! That's just about the worst editing fail I've seen yet.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"Oops... 34:33 There's a guy scurrying around behind the actors, screen left ! Maybe he's after the 2-way radio left on the  porch rail a little earlier.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,A full thriller movie.,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"i dont know about movie,but who idiot call this playlist ""full porn movie5"" is he okay.",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,This movies sucked big time very boring no purpose no meaning dnt watch it ,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,Boring,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,WTF I could the mic on the side of the picture 35:58min just before they jumped in the water and also someone was there while they were talking .. What a dumb as movie,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,they are still in the car driving and nothing is happening when more than 10 min are finished of the movie....................10.55 they go out lol............very annoying people. They go back in the car little after 13 min and keep on driving and almost nothing is said.   Ssooooooooooo slow!! They call this a thriller???,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,"Sad when two people that once loved one another, get to this point....why even bother to go on a trip together and make each other feel so uncomfortable...",,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,For 20 minutes nothing happenz,,,,,,,
fqF-3urweOk ,this movie was so boring i felt asleep the first fifteen minutes what kind of thriller movie is this. ,,,,,,,

RxAtuMu_ph4,"I just thought of something, when red skull said it was permanent and she wouldn’t come back, think how gamora came back, she died for the soul stone and then came back with the time machine, so it was possible to bring back gamora, so it’s possible to bring back black widow",,,,,,,
RxAtuMu_ph4,Spoiler: She dies a few movies later,,,,,,,
RxAtuMu_ph4,"Okay, serious question here. About 26 seconds in you hear a man say ""I heard you had to leave in a hurry."" Now, I know it sounds like William Hurt, and they show a younger-looking Gen. Ross about that time, but to me it makes no sense that Gen. Ross would be talking to her after the events of the Civil War. Especially since Ross didn't look like that in Civil War, I think that's clearly a flashback scene going back several years. Also, Marvel is famous for putting out fake stuff to throw us off track (like Hulk in Infinity War trailer), so I'm wondering if she's talking to someone else, like Tony Stark? And maybe they doctored the voice to SOUND like Gen. Ross???",,,,,,,
RxAtuMu_ph4,I need this,,,,,,,
RxAtuMu_ph4,There's some of these scenes in Age of Ultron. Cool.,,,,,,,

Then she was going to run away from her past and move to paris but the hulk knew she loved Ice Cream so it looked like she stayed with him and found true love.,,,,,,,

RxAtuMu_ph4,Marvel: Hey wanna cry again?,,,,,,,
RxAtuMu_ph4,"It is unacceptable, inconceivable that even after the Matrix, Chalie's Angels, Kill Bill, Aeon Flux Marvel will still do fight scenes in which a double stunt does practically every kick or punch, and not just acrobatics, becomes ""the fight for the fight"" , in addition to having the audience's lack of perception. It is not what I want to see in a film whose protagonist specializes in martial arts. Interpreting is more than doing facial and body expressions, or being good at scenes of comic relief and dramatic appeal. Scarlett Johansson in all these years has only given Black Widow a face, but has never given legitimacy or authenticity to her fight scenes. Marvel deserves to be compared to an amusement park, as it has learned to make easy money with an audience that accepts everything.",,,,,,,

RxAtuMu_ph4,"I had a thought about spiders. I just wanted to understand something, the Black Widow has a large body, characterized by a red spot on the back abdomen. While the male counter part is extremely small in comparison. So, any person who carries a signature of a Black Widow, would  undoubtable make their partners feel smaller then them. As far as presence and visibility. The Female rules in the spider world. My question is this, is there at all possibility, that a Fly and a Spider would ever cross paths?  Could there be love with in that encounter? As far as I am understanding, the only Fly that could ever get close to a spider like that. One that traps so many men with in her web, is one who has a little spider of a mind. You need a film that shows her going against a Spider Fly...in other words Hi Scarlett!...teehee…. It's me, Jon.

I do wonder if there is perhaps clones of Natasha involved. She did say she lived a lot of lives. What if Natasha is really alive and she used one of her clones for the last two Avengers? They have her memories and the same combat skills as she does, or perhaps they would use her clones after Natasha’s death in Endgame?! I am just guessing...",,,,,,,

7MIC4P306Cg,I like how they had Vision say “something isn’t beautiful because it lasts” as we see shots from spider man movies,,,,,,,
7MIC4P306Cg,"As phenomenal as this it is, I'd like it a bit more if Far From Home wasn't in it. I'd prefer the Infinity Saga by itself and have it end with Endgame rather than an intro to Phase 4 because then it's like the saga ends on a cliffhanger.",,,,,,,
7MIC4P306Cg,"Infinity Saga will end up being the best cinematic series ever made. Glad I was around to see it.  Like Tony said, “What a ride”. ?????????",,,,,,,

7MIC4P306Cg,"I tried to look this up after seeing this, and I couldn't find the product itself (I can look harder, or wait of course) but I did see an article pointing out Black Panther was missing from the lineup. Now I don't think this is any more than an oversight, but I'm wondering if people can spot any other titles missing. I can't think of one myself.",,,,,,,

7MIC4P306Cg,The iron man 3 theme sounds amazing and then it mixed with the captain america theme.. why doesn't they use those theme more often ?,,,,,,,
7MIC4P306Cg,So universal let MARVEL use incredibly hulk footage for this trailer (unlike the to the end endgame trailer) but Sony wouldn't let them use homecoming and far from home footage. I mean ffh ended this saga,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,RDJ.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,Dave Bautista.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,RDJ,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,RDJ is iron man. Stan Lee said as much. Said he was perfect and exactly what he imagined. Imagine that kind of praise. Even RDJ's improv is spot on. Stan knew talent gold when he saw it.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,"I love Robert Downey Jr’s performances as Tony Stark, he absolutely nails it and makes the character of Iron Man his own. I can’t imagine anyone else as Iron Man.",,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,Being handed stuff.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,Sadly a great one that was missed was the thor ragnorak scene where thor gives the story of the snake,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,Erm... HawkEye was first introduced in Thor - he was looking over the compound where the hammer was found. Avengers was his second film.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,"9:06 they said tony didn’t offer Steve any blueberries, but he did about 2 mins later in the film",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,My takeaway during Doctor Strange was that Wong was specifically listening to Beyoncé due to the earlier reference.,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,"Wait, the actor's name that plays Wong's name is Benedict Wong?",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,one also should have been mentioned was the scene of Star Lord drops the ORB with Power stone.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,"He was supposed to take it out and give it, but Chris Pratt just dropped it, and quickly picked it up and stood like nothing had happened, that was a blooper more than it was improvised, but it made it to the final film.",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,For those who don't know Iron Man 1 was  entirely improvised.,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,Is it me or are Screen Rant and CBR the same channel with the same narrators except different playlists and one of them don’t put Dragon Ball Z and one doesn’t have Pitch Meetings in their videos?,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,"Okay, the purple fletched arrow sticking out of his back might be a clue.",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,You could have actually had the actual lines in your video. This really sucked.,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,Sony: too bad,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,RDJ is the king of improvising ,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,Just another thing to add to they list on why RDJ is the best actor in the world ?????,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,David Tennant said the line before Tom Holland.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,"Also the blueberry thing, He did offer steve some later in the scene",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,I love how RDJ knows Tom Holland is good at improv too and just expects him to go along which usally works out. This is why old movies sometimes seem really bad now. In new movies the improv gets more and more which makes everything sound so much more real.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,What about tony's death scene where Gwyneth paltrow and others improvised their last talk to tony.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,"Tom Holland being English, I'm fairly certain the ""I don't wanna go"" line was at least partly inspired by David Tennant's last line as the Doctor in 'Doctor Who'.",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,Robert Downey Jr. could've easily have told Thanos in Endgame:,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,"somewhere i think that Tom Holland was inspired by david tennant with the ""I dont wanna go"" line",,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,"people need to learn the difference between ""improvised"" as in came up with by the actors during the shoot, discussed with the director, and shot as one of many different takes tried a few ways, and ""improvised"" as in totally ad-libbed in the moment while the camera was rolling. these are not the same thing.",,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,RDJ is just an amazing character ???,,,,,,,

hvUY8hBUvrs,12:55 really? He listened later because Dr. Strange mentioned it. It showed he didn't just ignore him (how it looked like) but actually listened to Strange and was curious about it.,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,number 19 when I heard that quote I thought he was talking as Quicksilver trying to explain that he ran away and left Hawkeye behind and that was assuming that they never found him,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,I quote the MCU everyday of my life,,,,,,,
hvUY8hBUvrs,I just feel like the Tom Holland line from infinity wars was because he didn’t get a script for that scene,,,,,,,

tw9Uo1R8tZs ,Ragnarok establishes that while Thor has been away... Loki was not protecting the Nine Realms.  Since Loki impersonated Odin at the end of Dark World... which is before Age of Ultron... it is reasonable to assume that Thanos pressured Eitri into making the gauntlet between these films and therefore does not upset the continuity of the timeline.,,,,,,,

zAdo7CnD1fg ,Sick of thumbnail pictures that has nothing to do with the video,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Disagree with the assessment of James Spader's performance of Ultron. He did a great job especially as a sole voice actor like Josh Brolin.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,click bate for people who where expecting Brie Larson lol.. me too,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,There was nothing wrong with James Spader's portrayal of Ultron. Its was spot on.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Annoying how this guy has no idea what he's talking about.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I loved James's portrayal of Ultron,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Are you kidding? James Spader's Ultron has a sense of pity on humans, which was spoton",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"do you even know what fired means? to terminate a contract! most of them had contract for a single movie, they got the job done and they left",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,James Spader did a great job as Ultron.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Dude.... Ultron is my favorite villan to date. Age of Ultron is still my favorite avengers movie. I had no problem w the portrayal.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Video starts at 2:12 everything before that is blah blah blah,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,A. James Spader was amazing as ultron and there was nothing wrong with it ,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,B. I actually enjoyed the hulk and it was part of the mcu,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"C. What does the thumbnail have to do with the video, I mean I know Brie Larson causes trouble on set but she was nowhere near getting fired ",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"These actors had contracts. Some contracts was longer than others. contracts depending on the character, Maria hill still has a contract and in her contract marvel could call her in to appear in any upcoming movie. So even though her roles was short she could still return at any moment if Marvel needs her. Chris Evans contract was supposed to be over before infinity war he extended it. Thor’s contract was extended after ragnarok. The reason why I know this because I spend time with these characters and constantly watching the movies and reading the comics. plus it’s on google. marvel didn’t kick them out. eventually these actors will get old and they have to replace them with younger actors. That’s business. This is the stupidest channel that ever came up on my newsfeed and with the most inaccurate information. Find a new job",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Spader's Ultron was spot on perfect casting!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Clickbait, a ton of this is just explaining what the MCU is, highlighting characters that ended simply due to poor writing, only one that an actual firing.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"James did a great job, it was the director's fault for making such a weak film and sequel.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I thought Ultron was perfect!!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I believe Terence after all it falls in line with what Stan Lee's daughter said of how they treated her father.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"After years of Steve saying ""I could do this all day"" he finally realized that its pretty annoying",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,James portrayed Ultron amazingly well,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,the incredible hulk was always meant to be in the mcu. stark appears at the end of it.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,If Terrence hadn't been hired then RDJ would probably never have been considered for the role of Tony Stark and the MCU would have looked very different.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Regarding James Spader as Ultron, is the director of that movie not responsible for the actors portrayal of there characters?  Of course the main actors do have some input the role of their characters, but ultimately it does come back to the director.  I believe your version of responsibility on the actor instead of the director is grossly unfair.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,They blame uptrons actor yet the script was poor,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,SPADER WAS PERFECT AS ULTRON! The script was trash,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"I like how they have Brie Larson on the cover of this video, abit disappointed that she wasn't really featured in this video..",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Terrence didn't get fired..he walked as Mickey did.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,How was the hulk not part of the MCU when Iron Man shows up in the end of the movie,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I like don cheadle as war machine but I absolutely would’ve had a closer emotional connection to the character of it stayed with Terrance Howard.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"most of them in the list were not fired, their characters just had no longer purpose in the mcu, and mostly bec. they are dead.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Two minutes and 10 seconds!  Get to the point!!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I thought Spader's  performance was excellent and especially liked that he didn't twirl his mustache.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Loved ultranationalist voice!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Phooey.   James Spader was great as Ultron,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Then there’s the case of Clark Gregg. One of the iconic characters in the early movies and one of the best casting choices , then exiled to AOS which ultimately gets disconnected from the MCU. C’mon, the guy now has Kree blood and loads of space travel experience. He deserves another shot.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Personally, I thought Spader was  a great Ultron.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Loki is the hero of his show he will fight against other villains maybe thanos and his children himself hela and other cosmic villains.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Every picture of Mr. Fiegie makes him look like he just felt something slip out that wasn't gas.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,You have to play your role well in order to have your role longer and to star in movies. That's how Marvel's actors did it!!!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Man this makes me feel some type of way.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Can someone tell me whats happening in the thumbnail?,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Ultron is my favourite mcu villian purely because of James Spader. I just don’t see anyone else being able to articulate the role in the same way he did.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I keep getting terence (rhody) ,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Mixed with cooba gooding junior,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I do still mis him cause i have to say i loved him more as Rhodes,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Terrence got paid less and Mickey got a lot of scenes cut from the movie and he prepared very hard for them...,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Saying Spader was not the right pick is right where this video ended for me.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"There is no ""X"" in ""especially""!!!!",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Its ok when fired at Marvel you can find work at DC. when fired at DC you can find work at Marvel,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Everyone believes what they hear or record or I what I said etc... fools!!,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Ah yes, I remember that time Marvel fired Brie Larson for... I'm gonna guess some jewelery that she was wearing? Anyways, that's why Katheryn Winnick plays Captain Marvel now.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,the thumbnail almosT killed me........,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,If he was still in the mcu he wouldn't have been in empire,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,The incredible hulk was my favorite marvel movie,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"I actually like James Spader as Ultron, though I will disagree less with assertions that Avengers 2 was a weaker film.",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Spade's Ultron mirrored quite well elements of his creators (Tony and Bruce) and the dark sides of their personalities...the arrogance and ego of Stark with Banner's habit of viewing things through a two-sides-only perspective.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Did he just say 'expecially'?  haha garbage tier,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Terrance be like: Hey yo, what’s goin on wit my cash flow, Iron Mayne?",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,I really like the character of wanda who can both as a hero as well as even greater villain.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Other than Loki + Thanos there have been no other long running villains in the mcu that I can think of. Also I think they should have a villain who (not sits in the background and commands from the shadows) but one who is always a present kind of like Loki but more involved and longer running.,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"Ultron was made after tony, took to his personality, and meant to be sinister. And the continuous talking from ultron was supposed to be that way",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,"That Incredible Hulk movie is actually canon to the MCU. It contains a post credit scene featuring RDJ, and the general Ross in the movie is the same general Ross in the MCU AND footage from the movie pops up in the first avengers when tony looks at the file containing info on the other avengers( before they actually formed the avengers). So that movie is canon to the MCU ?????",,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,Would have been hilarious if Hemsworth metoo'd Larson,,,,,,,
zAdo7CnD1fg ,The news in this vid is so old you should have been embarrassed to post it. ,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"Let’s be honest, if Elizabeth Olsen wore the suit thy scarlet witch wears in the comics then the Movie wouldn’t be rated PG-13?",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"Drax stands out whether he is green, gray, or invisible.",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Armor Logic:,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"Men - More armor,More Protection",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Elizabeth Olsen definitely does Scarlet Witch’s trademark cleavage justice,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,I bet 80% of the comments are about Elizabeth olsen,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"Don’t let this distract you from the fact, Quicksilver is still dead in the MCU.",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Elizabeth Olsen in a corset or outfit from comic book. I wouldn't complain to either way,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"2:17 ""Major Dr. Strange vibe"" ??? Really? He looks more like Batman which is probably why they left it out.",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Good thing Black Widow's costume didn't change,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,I'd be seriously confused,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,The ancient one punched banners spirit out of hulk ,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E , Mind blown ?,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Y’all either perverts or just weird I liked the new Scarlet witch a lot!! The old was one was nude and that would totes hate the suit jk..... but seriously I like this suit,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"They have said Zemo will get his mask in the Falcon, and Winter Soldier.",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Do you honestly think that Elizabeth Olsen wants to look like a playboy bunny in the film??? And that people wanted to see her wearing that costume??,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Cbr has two things constant! !,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,1 . 0 views 27? ???,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,2.Avengers videos ????,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Atleast give Wanda her wimple. Zemo's getting his mask and Mysterio got his fishbowl.,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,Omg I wish we had comic version of scarlet witch.  ,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,I love Elizabeth Olsen,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"I love how the costumes in movies covered the bodies, for both females and males. Its about their story and powers, not their bodies. Thank u Marvel",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,CBR: Transformation from comics to MCU ,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,"Me: ah shoot, here we go again........",,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,BTW I Like your videos........,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,um to be honest i think the mcu did a huge improvement on the comics because to be honest some of the comic outfits looked inappropriate so I'm thankful for the mcu making the outfits very modern and also appropriate,,,,,,,
M49nPeLbY-E ,CBR you forgot Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy 2. ,,,,,,,

_K2Bt4L6a2Y,"Loki's death was way more than an honorable mention, to me at least. I remember through the rest of the movie waiting for him to come back, regardless of what Thanos said. Not only did I enjoy the way Tom Hiddleston played  him, but his character had such a cool ark. Even though you were never entirely sure which side he was fighting for, you could still see that character development. And really, the ambiguous, changeable, nature of his moral compass (or lack thereof) made him that much more interesting. Loki, Black Widow, and Quiksilver were the ones that hurt the most to me.",,,,,,,

CX17qmYO0o0,"Robert Downey, Jr ""Ironman"" had a contract with Marvel, But the expenses were getting high for the CGI, Suits and Wage was getting high. This meant cutting him from the industry was the best option, Robert even agreed on this. ( I think )",,,,,,,

CX17qmYO0o0,"I read a theory about Cap traveled back in time to return the stones, he got Nat back in exchange for the soul stone and then Nat helped him return all of the remaining stones and she helped him fix all of the stuff that they messed up when they collected the stones...he didn't marry Peggy because that will change the future, and marrying Peggy will prevent her from marrying the husband that she married when Steve froze in ice, so he just stopped by to dance with her. Then when they were ready to go home they only had 1 pym particle left, so they promised to stay and only return if one of them dies. Years passed and Nat and Steve got married, lived life together until Nat died and that's when cap returned to inform everyone that everything  was okay. But when Sam asked who the girl Steve married, he refused to tell him because it was actually Nat. I really love this theory tho what do you guys think??",,,,,,,

CX17qmYO0o0,Only looking forward for Spider-Man dr strange 2 black panther 2 and black widow ...,,,,,,,
CX17qmYO0o0,I would like to see the Fantastic Four introduced in the Black Panther sequel. It would be fitting for the MCU's Fantastic Four to first appear in a Black Panther movie since Black Panther first appeared in a Fantastic Four comic. They could team up to fight Doctor Doom. Since Loki was killed in Infinity War I think Doom would be the ideal character to fill the void as a recurring villain for the entire MCU. It could also set up a Fantastic Four solo movie.,,,,,,,

2J7x2Y3f4Is,Who copied more?,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Who did it better?,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,MARVEL FANS LIKE!!!,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,DC FANS COMENTS!!!,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,My opinion on the best,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Movie wise: Marvel ,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Bane is absolutely not a copy cat of Crossbones.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Catwoman actually was created in the early 1940’s.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,My opinion,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Marvel: Movies,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,6:50 I think the Bible did this one first.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,"Her: ""Me being such a superhero fangirl""",,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Also Her: Half of the video compares two completely different characters with no similarities whatsoever.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,"Maybe Marvel didn’t copy dc, dc probably just inspired them",,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,"Personally, I'm a fan of both. Ever since I was a kid I fell in love with both the Avengers and Justice League. In my opinion, although Marvel did ""copy"" many DC characters they did it ""better"" because their cinematic universe is much stronger than DC's. However, I prefer DC's comics to Marvel's. Both franchises are strong in their own ways, but I feel that DC could use better director's and more famous actors. I mean, if we had someone dope like Hugh Jackman play Batman or someone else really famous and well known, the two wouldn't even be comparable. I'm not saying Marvel is over hyped, but I will admit that DC is under appreciated.",,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Seriously!? Comparing Joker and the Green Goblin? C'mon,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,"DC: live action solo movies or one off movies, animated movies, tv shows,   video games, comics, and action figures.",,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Marvel: live action cross over or team up movies.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,33-17 :)DC always better than Marvel..One moment Lobo strongest than Wolverine.,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,By far DC has the best animated movies,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Dc arrived first on comic book history,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,Alot of this ain't even copycats,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,i was a dc man all my life. Sometime in my 20s i realised how stupid that was. Go Comics! In General!!!,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,6:53 Lucifer Morningstar from DC,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,6:42 makes no sense because dc also has their own lucifer even though he's vertigo,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,04:53:00 AM,,,,,,,
2J7x2Y3f4Is,It’s BIZZARO!,,,,,,,

The hulk can survive better than superman in space. Hulk can survive in zero environments. His body adapts and did in the past...didn't you so-called comic experts ever read the start of planet hulk? NO you guys didn't.  In fact the exact technique you suggested Superman use was tried by Gladiator. A guy who has the exact same powers as Superman and is arguably stronger, faster and definitely a better fighter than Superman. He tried flying Hulk in space didn't work. He used heat vision didn't work. He got his butt beat. You guys don't have a comment area in your articles I imagine to prevent people from exposing your lack of knowledge.  ",,,,,,,

As for the ""Spider-Man"" situation, it seems unclear rather ""Marvel Studios"" will still finish Tom Holland's Spider-Man story, since Sony had parted ways with Disney/Marvel, but I'd be open to seeing Spider-Man in ""Venom 2"" and maybe either the ""Black Cat"" or ""Silver Sable"" movies.",,,,,,,

BaiFRsPZe-8,I'm a Marvel fan but even I gotta admit that these are amazing,,,,,,,
BaiFRsPZe-8,Under the red hood is my number 1. Absolute master piece,,,,,,,
BaiFRsPZe-8,"Under The Red Hood, will always be my favorite.",,,,,,,

BaiFRsPZe-8,Superman/batman:public enemies. Superman/batman:apocalypse. Justice league war?????,,,,,,,
BaiFRsPZe-8,Assault on Arkham? It should have been on the actual top 10s,,,,,,,
BaiFRsPZe-8,This is the one time I think WatchMojo got a list right yes there are if you movies that probably should have been on here but overall I say a stellar job,,,,,,,
BaiFRsPZe-8,"""It's hard to imagine a world without Superman....""",,,,,,,

vBfLnSEMNi4,The Dark Knight is number 1.,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Incredibles over Logan ? WTF!,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,"So chronicle kickass is better than Batman begins, spiderman 1,Blade,the dark knight rises,Thor 1 ",,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,I am a fan of looper but this ranking is bad,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Heath Ledger will always be THE best Joker of all time. ,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Change my mind.,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Winter Soldier is below Black Panther? Seriously? It was good but it wasn't anywhere near TWS.,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Logan under The Incredibles? What are you smoking?,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,"The Dark Knight really deserves the #1 spot. Still a great performance from Heath Ledger ""Why So Serious?",,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Ok winter soldier is way better than the other two,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Its nearly impossible to beat the dark knight. I actually think it will stay as the best superhero movie of history,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,My top 3:,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,1. The Dark Knight,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,2. Spiderman 2,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,3. Logan,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,I like it.  but batman begins should be top 10 somewhere,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,No 1 Dark Knight I am making my prediction.,,,,,,,

vBfLnSEMNi4,There is no way incredibles is over Logan and Deadool lmao ??,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,"Respect for that top 3. Spider-Man 2 to me is the greatest, but can’t argue with dark knight.",,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Guardians of the galaxy is too low.,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,Who else expected Dark Knight to be the number one best “superhero” film?,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,When i watched Avengers Endgame i thought its the best superhero movie.,,,,,,,
vBfLnSEMNi4,"Then a few days back i got to watch The Dark Knight again, no offence to any one bt its just unbeatable",,,,,,,

SpAsaA9TARQ,Flahpoint paradox... anyone?...,,,,,,,
SpAsaA9TARQ,Batman is life...although Flashpoint Paradox should have been in this list. Also is it just me or was I the only one who wasn't into Superman/Batman:Apocalypse? I found Kara's character development lacking IMO,,,,,,,
SpAsaA9TARQ,"Go DC! Your live action movies are iffy, but you're animated movies are spot on!!",,,,,,,
SpAsaA9TARQ,Now if only DC could apply this quality to their live action movies...,,,,,,,
SpAsaA9TARQ,I wish DC's live action movies could be as good as it's animated movies.,,,,,,,
SpAsaA9TARQ,"Funny how Eight of the Ten on this list are DC Films. It just shows that while Marvel rules the silver screen, DC shines bright in the animated films. Also, glad Mask of the Phantasm was #1. That movie sealed The Joker as arguably my favorite villain of all time.",,,,,,,

0IuEwKCvoI4,"Definitely want to see Shazam, Wonder Woman, would love to see Deathstroke, how about an Azrael movie, Nightwing hit or miss, Deadshot sounds kewl, Id definitely like to see another Suicide Squad movie, 1 maybe around the character of Katana, Blue Beatle sounds interesting.",,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,Plastic Man appears heavily in the Justice League: Action animated series.,,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,How about we just finally get a film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Sandman?,,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,"I want a good Nightwing movie, that's all I want from this universe, I really dont care about the rest. Since the comics have refused to give us some decent Nightwing stuff for at least 5 years now. Every batman or titans related movie that comes out before Nightwing I consider to be a slap in the face XD",,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,I'm just going to wait until I see a trailer.,,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,Most of these movies are stuck in development hell though,,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,"I wonder, are any of these going to be animated movies?",,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,What a good video,,,,,,,
0IuEwKCvoI4,"Superhero fatigue has already set in as far as I'm concerned. We do need a little break.  And people are so critical immediatly anyway. I sure don't need a Lobo film. But development is one thing, reality is another. I thought Mark Strong was a good Sinestro but I don't see him as Sivana. Looking forward to Shazam,(the real Captain Marvel!). Maybe DC looked at the X-men movies and thought ""yeah, that's the type of continuity we want! "" And I'm not a fan of movies where the villains are the main characters. ",,,,,,,
