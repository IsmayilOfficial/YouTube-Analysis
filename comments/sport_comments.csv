3TJP5a3pBME,"thank you popsugar fitness, I love this! I never thought I would say this, but the toning sections here are AWESOME! and the cardio is lit, like always. please do more! and bring this trainer back please!",
3TJP5a3pBME,"Loved the workout, I sweat buckets!  Just one thing: please refrain from using negative phrases like ""I know you are tired"" ""I am tired too"" ""Are you tired yet?""..i felt like my energy levels dropped every time I heard the trainer say it. And my mind gave up before my body did. Otherwise, the workout was great and sweaty!",
3TJP5a3pBME,Do not overestimate the 20 minutes! They are so so worth it! Bring her back for 30 and 45 minute workout please!,
3TJP5a3pBME,Phew - feeling the impact Ladies! Good job! ????,
3TJP5a3pBME,"This was the worst popsugar fitnessworkout ever. The exercises perfect, execution poorest. Why did she not say we will do 11 exercises, a minute each, no break. What is up with this : just a bit more, just a bit more , almost done, 20 more seconds, almost done, ugh so tired. Just put a timer and define clearly the workout. The workout energy was just not there in this one. Also putting 5 ads one after another, that last 5 mins each, I always watch them at the end of the video but why interrupt the flow ? I had to get out of the plank to skip an ad, to have another double add immediately after that I could not skip.",
3TJP5a3pBME,This made me sweat like I didn’t think it would but somehow i felt frustrated throughout..perhaps a little dull.,
3TJP5a3pBME,Amazing full body work!!!! Lovin' this burn!,
3TJP5a3pBME,Have a blessed day everyone!,
3TJP5a3pBME,"I love this workout! Very easy exercises, I really liked that you also included the ""modified"" versions! Definitely gonna subscribe <33",

3TJP5a3pBME,How would you classify this for people who keep track on a fitness diary and calorie? Under what name could I register this for example on MyFitnessPal?,
3TJP5a3pBME,"Great workout!  High intensity but easy to stay on track.  I feel awesome!  Thank you, PS!",
3TJP5a3pBME,This has become one of my favorite PopSugar Workouts. Have done this one repeatedly!,
3TJP5a3pBME,"To be honest, I didn't like this video that much. I think the time for each exercice was too long for me. I prefer when we do 2 or more circuit so I am not bored as much! But I have sweat a lot so that's good!",
3TJP5a3pBME,"Exercícios de força ,mt bom!!!",

3TJP5a3pBME,Great job and thanks ? ???,
3TJP5a3pBME,???? ????,
3TJP5a3pBME,"Literally pouring with sweat ! Amazing work-out. Although @popsugarfitness just to mention one thing that kinda pull me back at times. My effort is definitely linked to my mental, especially when i'm out of breath and close from just giving-up. And when i hear from the trainer (Victoria) things like ""my legs are dying"" or other kinda stuff, i'll tend to just stop (which is no good i know), on the contrary, when i hear more encouraging words like ""hang-in there"", ""almost done"", i'll just give all i got. Anyway my point is, during work-out, maybe tend to keep it positive and encouraging, also in the words you say, cause they can make a difference. Anyway keep-up the good work! Cheers",
3TJP5a3pBME,Workout I love it,
3TJP5a3pBME,when is the new cut workout coming out with Christa? I can't wait for it!! :) ,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Club der Menschen, die absolut kein Interesse daran haben, je Sport zu studieren und trotzdem solche Dokus lieben ???",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Physik noch mitschreiben um den Schnitt für die ex Kommilitonen zu drücken - Ehrenmann!,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich habe  tiefsten Respekt vor Asghar. Seine Leistungen und sein Wille sind absolut bewundernswert. Was für ein beeindruckender Mann.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Durchfallquote 50%?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Beim Schwimmen stell ich mir das unappetitlich vor.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich hoffe Asghar schafft es nächstes Jahr. Ein sehr sympathischer Mensch.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Die wirken teilweise so unvorbereitet. Als angehender Sport Student keinen handstand Abrollen können?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Schade finde ich es schon, dass der Ringer raus ist. Hoffe er versucht es nochmal und übt seine Schwimmtechnik bis dahin schön fleißig. Respekt, dass er für den Test schwimmen gelernt hat, hat nur leider noch nicht gereicht. Ich fand seinen Prüfer aber nett, der hat ihn noch aufgemuntert, dass das jeder lernen kann.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Könnt ihr mal den Eignungstest an einer Kunsthochschule dokumentieren? Anforderungen an die Mappe und deren Beurteilung etc.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Warum wird der Körperbau nicht mit in die Bewertung eingeschlossen? Ist doch klar, dass man als Ringer nicht für Sprints gebaut ist, dafür hat der Asghar andere Stärken. Ringen ist im Iran Nationalsport und falls er wirklich mal Jugendweltmeister gewesen ist, könnte man seine Fähigkeiten an einer Sporthochschule schon gebrauchen, finde ich. ",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Hero of the day: Asghar.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ist Asghar eigentlich Ringer und aus dem Iran? Ich finde man hätte es NOCH ÖFTER sagen können,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Hach, ich liebe diese jährlichen Sport-Eignungstests-Dokus ?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Die Turndozentin ist sehr nett, bei ihr würde ich mich viel wohler fühlen wenn ich vorturnen müsste",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ganz schwaches Niveau teilweise, wenn das der große Traum von manchen ist sollte die Vorbereitung das A & O sein.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich studiere auch an der Sporthochschule und darum hier nochmal ein paar Sachen zum Eignungstest und dem Studium im Gesamten. Ich lese hier nämlich relativ viel Bullshit :D            1. die Bretter sind extrem weich und es fühlt sich einfach so an, als wenn man auf einem Trampolin springt. Ich bin mir sicher, dass der junge Mann im Video vorher einen einigermaßen akzeptablen Kopfsprung machen  konnte. Ich gehe jede Wette ein, dass es das Brett war, was ihm den Sprung versaut hat. Dadurch, dass es so weich ist braucht man einfach viel Körperspannung und Beherrschung, die bei ihm leider nicht vorhanden war.                                                             2. Da sich hier viele beschweren, dass der Ringer durchgefallen ist. Es gibt Kriterien wie dieser Test abzulaufen hat. Und es ist von vornherein klar, dass man bei einem 2. Defizit raus ist. Da spielt es absolut keine Rolle wie gut derjenige in einer Sportart ist, oder wann er sich das Schwimmen beigebracht hat. Diese Regeln sind von Anfang an klar, und dann brauch man sich auch nicht wundern, wenn man dann doch plötzlich raus ist. Der Test ist schließlich dafür bekannt, dass dort 50% durchfallen. Die Quote wäre viel niedriger, wenn die Prüfer immer ein Auge zudrücken würden, denn der Ringer war sicherlich kein Einzelfall. Das werden die häufig zu sehen bekommen solche Situationen.                                                       3. Es gibt 5 Bachelorstudiengänge und den Lehramtstudiengang an der Sporthochschule. Und ja, auch mit einem Sportwissenschaftsstudium kann man was werden. Und das mag für den einen oder anderen unvorstellbar sein, aber es gibt genug Bereiche in der Gesellschaft, wo einfach Sportwissenschaftler gebraucht werden. Sei es z.B im Gesundheitsbereich oder im Managementbereich, man wird was finden. Ob der Job letztendlich gut bezahlt wird und wo man landet, liegt bei jedem selbst in der Hand.        Also macht euch ein eigenes Bild vom Test und nehmt provisorisch dran teil. Ich bin mir sicher, dass viele den Test unterschätzen. Und jeder darf doch das studieren was man möchte. Und somit sollte niemand verurteilt werden, nur weil man sportbegeistert ist.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Die Kopfsprünge am Anfang sind ja der Hammer. ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Soll aber anscheinend ein besonderes Sprungbrett sein.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Meine Sportlehrer waren alle immer Übergewichtig.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Eigentlich ist Deutschland auf diesen Ringer angewiesen...falls seine Kridenzien überhaupt stimmen. Er kann einfach sich bei einem Ringverein telefonisch melden und dann wäre er sofort Trainer. Wir sind weltweit im Ringen das absolut Letzte...,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich bin nun wirklich kein guter Schwimmer aber wenn das mein Traum ist und ich doch weiß, was auf mich zu kommt, dann trainiert man doch wohl mal diesen Kopfsprung, vor allem wenn man weiß dann man es nicht beherrscht, oder?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Habe richtig mit Ashgar mitgefiebert schade.... Bin mir aber sicher, dass er es nächstes Jahr schafft",
lTI_B9ez-J8,bringt sich für den test extra das schwimmen bei weil mans im iran nicht als kind lernt,
lTI_B9ez-J8,fällt durch weil seine fußstellung nicht perfekt ist...,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Das ist so frustrierend mit dem Brustschwimmen bei Asghar? er hätte das wirklich verdient! Und 1/10 zu langsam, also wirklich...",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Gibt es beim Eignungstest eigentlich Raucherpausen?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wow der Ringer hat echt überall Muskeln.... sogar im Ohr!,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Hoffe er schafft es Nächstes Jahr,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Mega Respekt vor dem Ringer :o,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Hut ab vor allen die das schaffen. Mein größtes Respekt an Asghar. Er wird es beim nächsten Anlauf bestimmt schaffen.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,23:11 Glückwunsch hab mich riesig gefreut da er aus meiner Stadt kommt aber das man für das T-Shirt bezahlen muss als bestandener find ich schwach ?????.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Alle die hier ""qualifizierte"" Kommentare abgegeben und sich auch noch lustig darüber machen, dass etwas nicht gut klappt ...  Man muss nicht nur eine Sache gut machen ... ",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Nicht zu vergessen, um 6.00 Uhr (Anreisezeit kommt noch dazu) da sein und bis zum Lauf (ca. 17.00 Uhr) fit sein, das muss man erstmal nachmachen... Allen die sich dieser Prüfung stellen, Respekt!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Immer wenn ich nicht lernen will, lande ich bei diesen Dokus. Ohne Klausuren würde ich mir das safe nicht geben :´D",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich fände es mega wenn ihr nächstes Jahr den Ringer zu der Aufnahmeprüfung begleitet. Er war sehr sympathisch und sah so aus als würde er sich nicht unter kriegen lassen. Nächste mal schafft er es sicher ??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Also ich will nicht haten aber wenn es mein Traum ist Sportstudium zu machen dann trainier ich jeden Tag (nicht einmal die Woche) solange bis es klappt.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"11:38 ""Das ist auch akzeptabel""",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Bei 16:23, warum musste Tim nicht aus der Rolle rückwärts in den handstand, sondern nur eine Rolle rückwärts machen?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Tim digga was ist los mit dir? Stehst du auf Bauchklatscher ahahahah,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Die Spoho hält seit Jahren konstant die Durchfallquote bei ca. 50% ob das wohl Zufall ist?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Lieber NDR, vielen Dank für diese informative Doku! Wie wäre es mit einer Dokumentation über die Aufnahmeprüfungen in den Fächern Kunst und Musik?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich frage mich ja immer wie viele richtig gute und kluge Sportwissenschaftler durch solche Tests vergrault werden. Nur weil jemand eine Sportart nicht kann darf er nicht die nächste Biomechanische Gleichung entwickeln. Irgendwie komisch aber wenn sie Spitzenwissenschaflter nicht haben wollen dann sollen sie sie auch nicht bekommen.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Gibt es auch Wettessen dann melde ich mich an,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"19:50. ich fühle mit ihm. Er hat extra Schwimmen gelernt. Bei uns war es in der Grundschule usus. Ohne Gold abzeichen hat man seine Grundschulzeit nicht beendet. Ich finde da hätte man dann später im Studium mehr drauf achten müssen und alles wäre gut gewesen! Ja, wir lieben unsere Prüfungsrichtlinien, aber da hätte man durchaus etwas mehr mit Respekt arbeiten können/müssen.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,01:19:00 AM,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Zuschauer: Wie nah will der Kameramann noch zoomen.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wer zieht sich auch grad ne Pizza rein beim zuschauen?! ^^,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Als Physikstudent blutet mir doch ein wenig das Herz :D,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Aber natürlich Glückwunsch! Klasse, dass er jetzt etwas machen kann, dass ihm wirklich Spaß macht! :)",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich bin ja eigentlich recht sportlich, aber bei so vielen Anforderungen wäre ich total raus...",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Turnen zum Beispiel,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"2:36 Das 1 Meterbrett ist ein Wettkampfbrett, das muss man wissen - Axel Stoll",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Schon krass, vorallem bei sportmanagement braucht man zusätzlich noch ein 2,1 abischnitt",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"3:06 man sieht schon an seiner Körperhaltung, dass das nichts wird",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"07:29 Da spricht Monte, zweites Standbein? ??",
lTI_B9ez-J8,0:43 gehts der gut???,
lTI_B9ez-J8,11:32 ist doch von Klein gegen Groß immer die die zählt.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"""Um den Schnitt runter zu ziehen"" hahaha!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Sieger T-Shirt muss noch gekauft werdern haha,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich bin ehrlich gesagt geschockt... Ich möchte auch niemanden angreifen oder persönlich beurteilen,  aber die körperliche Koordinationsfähigkeit der Teilnehmer ist wirklich erschreckend , zudem wenn man die Zusatz Info bekommt, dass das das Ergebnis von einem Jahr VorbereitungsTraining sein soll.  Wirklich erschreckend.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Bei 12:00 gleich sicher bemerkt: das ist doch die wo bei Klein gehen Groß immer kontrolliert???? ILONA GERLING,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wenn man einfach mal in jeder Disziplin durchfallen würde. Ich. ??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,ein einziges trauerspiel ..,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Gibt es im emsland keine Schwimmbäder in denen man einen Sprung trainieren kann ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich würde lieber eine Sportart studieren, statt so allgemein. Wieso ist das in DE nicht möglich?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"2 Wochen im Turnverein, einmal die Woche turnen... Was das für'n ein Training",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Lieber Ringer ,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Wenn du magst, kann ich dir gerne das Schwimmen beibringen, bin ausgebildete Leistungsschwimmerin und Trainerin",
lTI_B9ez-J8,23:11 Glückwunsch hab mich riesig gefreut da er aus meiner Stadt kommt aber das man für das T-Shirt bezahlen muss als bestandener find ich schwach ?????.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,also zum mitschreiben: wenn ihr leidenschaftlich für eine Sportart brennt: nicht auf die Hochschule gehen. wenn ihr jede Sportart gerne auf amateur Niveau beherrschen wollt: greift zu,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Jedoch muss man sagen, dass Köln den schwierigsten Eignungstest hat. ",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Leipzig ist auch schwer, jedoch nicht so wie der in Köln. ",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Aber super, dass es darüber mal eine neue Doku gibt!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"""Er hängt der Unterschwung an den Umschwung dran, das ist die hohe Kunst."" lul, er hat einfach hart überdreht^^",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"13.4s auf 100 m und 1,40m hochsprung, absoluter wahnsinn!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich konnte bis zur Grundschule nicht Schwimmen und wurde vom Sportlehrer niedergemacht, weil ich nur Hundekraueln konnte...vielfach fehlt es einfach an ordentlichen Pädagogen und Lehrern. Wer Kopfsprung beherrscht, beherrscht auch seinen Körper und darum geht es",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Richtig toller Beitrag! ? Ich finde, dass der Zusammenhalt richtig gut wirkt! Sind halt alles Gleichgesinnte :)",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich schaue mir diese Doku, währneddessen ich fastfood esse und stinke :D",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"respekt an alle, die diese prüfung versuchen und sogar meistern",
lTI_B9ez-J8,3:45 ??? der is ja komplett lost. Was macht so jemand an einer der besten Sporthochschulen Deutschlands?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,boah sind die meisten girls da granaten,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Die Kopfsprünge am Anfang sind ja der Hammer. ? Soll aber anscheinend ein besonderes Sprungbrett sein.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,0:45 nein,
lTI_B9ez-J8,3:22 und das man das vorher übt oder so? ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wie kann man sich denn bei so einem Test bewerben und nicht mal einen vernünftigen Kopfsprung können? ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Das erste Mal schaue ich diese Doku mit bestandenem Test in der Tasche ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Tim hat ja null drauf HAHAHAHHA,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Aka “Mord als Traumberuf“,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"I love german discipline and fairness. If you don't get the marks you are simply out, there is no unequal treatment.",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wie kann man da bitte antreten wenn man nicht mal einen kopfsprung kann,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Was für eine Schande, Physik abzubrechen! :D",
lTI_B9ez-J8,3:23 3:45 Das bin sowas von ich...!???,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Und dann komm ich beim Hochsprung mit 1, 5m....",
lTI_B9ez-J8,ich verstehe nicht warum sich die Bewerber nicht auf die Übungen vorbereiten. Ich gehe doch zu keiner Prüfung ohne zu wissen ob ich die Mindestanforderungen einhalten kann,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Mega Respekt vor dem Ringer :o,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich war dabei am gleichen Tag dabei und hab die asta Helfer wieder erkannt ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Hatte leider ein Defizit im Turnen aber hab's trotzdem geschafft ?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Aber würde Tim mein Training sein würde ich mit Sport aufhören,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Geil, die Motivation, nie mehr Physik zu lernen hat es gemacht!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Manche sehen echt aus wie richtige Körperkrüppel ????,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich mach das nächstes Jahr aus Spaß mit. Nur um am Ende zu bestehen und zu sagen ich hasse Sport ??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Schade dass keine Teilnehmerin begleitet wurde! Ansonsten schöner Einblick!,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Durchfallquote 50%?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Beim Schwimmen stell ich mir das unappetitlich vor.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,warum wurden hier nur junge Männer begleitet?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Asghar ist einfach hulk,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"An dieser Stelle mal ein richtig fettes Lob an die Asta Helfer (dudes in den pinken t shirts) der SpoHo. Hab den Test auch dieses Jahr gemacht und die haben ein richtig gepusht, vorallem beim 3000m Lauf",
lTI_B9ez-J8,??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,1:25 Ehrenmann? aus meiner Stadt ?? direkt für ihn die Daumen gedrückt.,
lTI_B9ez-J8,22:53 haha ehrenmann ??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Sehr schöner Film. Hoffe das alle Darsteller/innen Ihre Ziele erreichen werden. :),
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Dachte kurz bei 2:26, die Stimme gehört Stefan Raab und es ist doch das TV Total Turmspringen",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ich kenne Asgar persönlich er ist bester Mann ?? nächstes mal schaffst du es ????,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Der Sportlehrer??,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wenn man nicht mal einen Hecht kann sollte man sich das mit Sport nochmal überlegen,
lTI_B9ez-J8,also ich sag mal so ich kann nur schwimmen und Fußball spielen reicht das? XD,
lTI_B9ez-J8,22:15 warum? Beim Bund werden auch keine Unterschiede bei den Anforderungen gemacht,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Kann man Mal bitte herausheben, wie coole Socken der Typ in Pink bei 19:00 hat???",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"omg die heutige Jugend,!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Schwimmen scheint ja nicht so beliebt zu sein?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Versteh nicht warum die Angst haben nen köpper vom 1er zu machen, bei uns im Dorf haben wir mit 12 nen Köpper von 5m hohen Bäumen gemacht?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Respekt, wer wäre gern auch so topfit wie diese Bewerber? ?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,besser bei der Aufnahmeprüfung scheitern... als mit falschen Illusionen im Studium zu Grunde gehen...,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"sehr hilfreich, danke!",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Schön gut so kann auch geilbien ???,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Asghar...warummmm,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Die bei 11:32 war ja mal richtig krass?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Wi ekann man den Sprung von dem Brett verkacken?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Oh man. Der Iraner tut mir so leid. Hätte ihm das echt sooo gegönnt :(,
lTI_B9ez-J8,Ab 22:25 wie heißt das Lied im Hintergrund?,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich kann immer nicht verstehen, warum so viele durchfallen. Habe den Test selbst bestanden und das Niveau vor Ort ist teilweise unterirdisch, obwohl die Anforderungen nicht so extrem sind",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Krass das der keine köpper hinbekommen hat ? das hat man doch als Kind im Sommer schon einfach so gemacht,
lTI_B9ez-J8,bitte bei 19:27 stoppen,
lTI_B9ez-J8,"Ich versteh ja alles mögliche, aber wie kann man den beim Kopfsprung von 1er verkacken?",
lTI_B9ez-J8,Der Test ist zu easy und die Teilnehmer zu unsportlich. ? ,
jHHNa41EGUE,Thanks to everyone who made the last 'Top 10 Weirdest Sport in the world' video a huge success.,
jHHNa41EGUE,To celebrate - here's part 2. Enjoy!,

kE7D7qFayVg,"By far the most diverse sports compilation vid I've seen out there! I'm guessing you're french by your name & a few of the clips in the vid (notably racing & rugby), but irrespective you added the american sports, but I was absolutely blown away by the handball, horse jumping, skiing, table tennis & rally driving etc. Nor was it that you overadded 1 because it was your favoured (arb.), sport(s). I guess, like me, you just love sport, yes rugby, football, & tennis are top of my list, buy that doesn't mean I don't like the others, & like to watch cricket, racing & golf etc when I can (though it's usually h/l's as that's the issue with liking too much: time to do & then watch everything), so thank you very much (although to be ever so slightly critical I feel there could've been a little more cricket & golf, but I also understand the length/time constraints of the vid, not wanting to make it an hr long I presume).",

c-XiD3pigdQ,"o sporte está uma negação, se continuar assim vai passar vergonha na série A do brasileiro",
c-XiD3pigdQ,Um forte candidato a saco de pancadas da primeira divisão.,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Meu imperatriz é gigante,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Este time do sport e horrível em se ñ cair tem que agradecer,

c-XiD3pigdQ,Barcelona? Ah não é o Imperatriz hihihi,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Respeita o Imperatriz... cavalo de aço ???,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Eu já falei e repito... Luan Poli e Mailson São goleiros pra ficar no banco! O Sport contratou o melhor goleiro da série B! É só da uma chance pro cara!,
c-XiD3pigdQ,"Esse goleiro do Imperatriz é ruim hein, o bicho parece que tem medo da bola, no primeiro gol se abaixou. ?????",
c-XiD3pigdQ,Nem goleiro de pelada faz uma merda dessa,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Luan Poli peloamor,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Eu sou rubro negro e confesso que o sport ta uma merda esse goleirinho é uma decepção não merece ser titular,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Orgulho de ver vc jogar cesinha além de fazer dois gols na cachorra de peruca e um torcedor do santa cruz desde criança. Colega de infância que vc tenha muito sucesso no Imperatriz meu amigo.???,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Copa do Nordeste é massa demais,
c-XiD3pigdQ,"Cavalo deu-lhe uma tremenda patada..... Imperatriz foi guerreiro,mesmo jogando fora vem desvantagem até os minutos finais, nao desistiu!! O elenco tá de parabéns!!!",
c-XiD3pigdQ,"Sou Sport mas q time horrível n tem confiança nem com 2 x 0 no placar,lamentável (só comentei agr pq meu celular tava quebrado e hj ganhei um novo",

c-XiD3pigdQ,Essa Copa do Nordeste que surpreende.,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Ai Guto barriga cadê teu time e uma vergonha eu venho dizendo o time e ruim este.e o pior time que o sport já montou. Não vai ganha nada a sempre a e perde um clássico e não vai demora .,

c-XiD3pigdQ,Pior que o Sport só o Jahia mesmo sendo eliminado para um time de serie D kkkkk,
c-XiD3pigdQ,#LampionsLeague,
c-XiD3pigdQ,Eita que o torcedor só quer resultado mas esquece que faltam jogadores para o time principal que não foram inscritos ainda. O time vai engrenar. O Guto subiu esse time e tem méritos. É um time novo e ja já vai acertar. Lembrem q o Sport tá quebrado e a culpa é mais da gestão do que do técnico. Torcedor parece q tem memória curta,
c-XiD3pigdQ,"Desse jeito quebra as aposta... uma merda dessa só faz empatar e em casa com os times ruins do Caralho, toma dois gols em um minuto do  Imperatriz pelo amor de Deus... isso é um time lixo!",

c-XiD3pigdQ,"Puta merda Sander, pra que isso? me diz, e outra, soco desnecessario o Luan foi dar na bola, sabia q tinha 2 jogadores em cima do jogador do Imperatriz, se o jogador do Imperatriz conseguisse cabeceiar, a cabecada seria fraca e daria para ele pegar!",
c-XiD3pigdQ,"Esse time só empata é? kkkkkkk Vermelho de luta, branco de paz! Aqui é Náutico!",
c-XiD3pigdQ,saída ridícula de polli e chico marcando o vento.,

c-XiD3pigdQ,"Jogadores bons, mas não respeitam o time que jogam só o ""bicho"" deles, ficou claro que foi panelinha, mas esse time vai dar a volta por cima quando trocarem o técnico...Contra o Ferroviário o presidente era Arnaldo Barros ai tinha razão de entregar o resultado mas agora não, o elenco está em dia com os salários jogadores mercenários...",
c-XiD3pigdQ,"O coice é bruto, é patada do cavalo no ispó",

This workout is only 20 minutes and to get out of the cardio flow becuase of jarring five second ads ruined it for me. It is even worse because the entire workout was already one giant ad, between the mats and awkward product placement by the instructor. Please reconsider if the ad money is worth losing several longtime followers.",

I3OIbbuZ1XE,Can someone please answer my question? So I'm trying to lose thigh fat and I'm pretty I'm sure lunges and squats make your thighs bigger and I definitely don't want that but some people say it's best for losing thigh fat. If someone could explain to me I'd appreciate it,
I3OIbbuZ1XE,does it burn the hip fat ?,
I3OIbbuZ1XE,"I'm sorry but the current VS Sport line is SO uncomfortable and unflattering.  I have the leggings they are wearing in this video and they are designed to be worn by freakishly tall people with teeny tiny waists-even the larger sizes cut into my stomach so bad it's really uncomfortable to wear.  And you can see it on the trainer in this video-she clearly has great abs and no excess fat, but her leggings are cutting into her waist making it look like she's got rolls. ",

juZQxFsHqJo,"""Exspecially""?  Jon Davis would never had said that.",
juZQxFsHqJo,VW Grand Cherokee ....minus  the off road ability and V8 power.,
juZQxFsHqJo,At least VW didn't try to give it a coupe body like Benz and BMW,
juZQxFsHqJo,"Seems severely under powered, expecially the 4 banger 2.0T",
juZQxFsHqJo,I'm really liking this vehicle!,
juZQxFsHqJo,I love the Atlas Cross Sport because it resembles the 2004 Land Rover Range Stormer concept! If they make it 2 doors I'm sold!,

juZQxFsHqJo,"You lost me when horsepower revealed, when it gets a 350 hp awd I’ll be heading to the dealer.",
juZQxFsHqJo,Lovely presenter. Oh and cool car.,
juZQxFsHqJo,Just beautiful.,
juZQxFsHqJo,V6 adds 7k? ?,
juZQxFsHqJo,Where is John Davis,
juZQxFsHqJo,Drove one of them in a v6 it felt very lazy! ,
juZQxFsHqJo,"Weak engine options. Time to add Audi’s 3L 349hp, 369tq engine. New design looks amazing!",

juZQxFsHqJo,"Looking forward to a longer take, maybe you will consider for long-term?",
juZQxFsHqJo,hideous.. how can they call this a volkswagen,
juZQxFsHqJo,7 thousand extra..for a weak V6. Lol,
juZQxFsHqJo,Cool a VW Ford Edge..,
juZQxFsHqJo,You are putting me to sleep Jessica...,
juZQxFsHqJo,I'm sorry how much of an increase for the V6??!!!$$$$$,
juZQxFsHqJo,"When does the Aviator come on sale ? What is the 0 to 60, what is the top speed ? It is March 8 th.  We have yet to see an Aviator  on the street. Please show us the track results on the Aviator ! Why does Motorweek Keep everything about the Aviator in cloak and dragger ?  We think this truck does not exist .",
juZQxFsHqJo,more sleek,
juZQxFsHqJo,"Test drove this car this past weekend and it handled great very smooth ride and great feel behind the wheel,  but there are two major drawbacks that will prevent me from even considering it. First the roof line is way too low when getting into the car, the seat must be put all the way down in order for a 5 foot 10 person to get in without hitting his head and to make things worse Volkswagen did not give the seats easy in easy out activation meaning they do not lower automatically when you turn the car off. So basically you need to adjust the sea every time you get in and out, without re-adjusting the seat, I could not get out of the car and that is also a major safety issue how is this ever passed safety is beyond me. The second issue is with the digital cockpit Display, why they would put eight point type in something you need to see clearly is beyond believe. It is incredibly difficult to read and illumination at maximum is barely readable. Two major flaws makes this a no go for me.",
juZQxFsHqJo,Well well well ,

juZQxFsHqJo,They should add the touareg's engine specs for the Atlas. Americans really get the worst engines when it comes to VW.,
juZQxFsHqJo,Seems very underpowered for its size,
juZQxFsHqJo,"Dogshit engines in this thing, and that's coming from a VW fanboy.",
juZQxFsHqJo,"I am laughing really hard at people who are saying it's ""slow"" and ""underpowered"". It still has more horsepower than the majority of cars in its class. The 2.0T with an APR st1 tune will be putting out more than 300hp easily. The V6 is smooth and refined. It will likely be running 0-60 in low 7s, which is plenty quick for this class.",
juZQxFsHqJo,"As Scotty says, too complicated for any mechanic to get it fixed, endless moneypits!!! ???",
juZQxFsHqJo,Another suv for the ?,
juZQxFsHqJo,"It's not a V6 Engine.  It is a VR6 Engine.  Awesome Engine, but not a V6.  Just look at the shot of the VR6 Engine spark plug alignment.",

juZQxFsHqJo,Handsome: It should look good even on the flatbed tow trucks that it will no doubt spend PLENTY of time on,
juZQxFsHqJo,It’s obviously the same platform as the Audi and Lamborghini that it is shaped exactly like. Why no mention of this?,
juZQxFsHqJo,Gr8 job Jessica !,

Brusque vai ter que se reforçar para a série C, trazer bons nomes, porque não temos peças de reposição à altura. Se o reizinho e o imperador se machucarem? Não temos ninguém para substituir no mesmo nível! Os 2 laterais são bons, Edilson e Airton, mas nao temos peça de reposição à altura. Os 2 são excelente apoiadores e cruzam certinho para dentro da área. Poderiam trazer aquele volantão Gerson que se destacou pelo Concórdio e depois pelo Tubarão. Trazer o Moisés de volta do Concórdia. Fabinho que está no Juventus, David Batista que jogou no Marcílio, Nathan do Marcílio, Paulinho do Marcílio, Tony Galego que enfretou o Bruscão ano passado, que era do Juazeirense, tem um tal e Paulo Vitor que era do Floresta e jogava muito ano passado, tinha uns jogadores do América/RN que jogava muito e foram desclassificados por detalhe.

rZXqPRvXdu4,Ice cross looks so fun and dangerous at the same time. Just like drinking Red Bull,
rZXqPRvXdu4,When did it change to ICE CROSS... it used to be CRASHED ICE,
rZXqPRvXdu4,For when hockey players have to many teeth,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Hope this helps you guys understand the sport a little more! Thanks for watching!,
rZXqPRvXdu4,At first I thought this was a new sport with more of a focus on jumps and speed and less gimmicky obstacles like a random boxing bag. But nope they just renamed crashed ice. Ice cross makes significantly more sense considering it's a non-contact sport.,
rZXqPRvXdu4,How tf can you dislike this,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Wow Red bull I love the skates sport .but even more I love the ice skating . It's my favourite .A big fan from NEPAL . PLEASE HIGHLIGHT MY COMMENT .,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Good luck at Japan Matthew Johnson love the hat!!,
rZXqPRvXdu4,I think a question that wasn't asked is something many of us have wondered: how do you start doing ice cross?,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Lives across the border in Minnesota,
rZXqPRvXdu4,"""Thanks to this sport, I never would have seen Canada"" ?",
rZXqPRvXdu4,"Red Bull always encouraged new sports , they where the first to help spread Parkour  and now this , they can't even be sure whether they can make profit out of this or not but still they do it . I never new  about ice skating .",
rZXqPRvXdu4,Looking forward to the new season!,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Wow those guys are amazing,
rZXqPRvXdu4,"I would like to be able to find vids of the first ever ice cross race but I can't find any, Red bull could you guys put a link of it on your ice cross downhill website? I would be very grateful.",
rZXqPRvXdu4,Wut happened with CRASHED ICE??? 0_o,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Good to see the split tails getting in on it,
rZXqPRvXdu4,So this sport is as old as me....,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Interesting,
rZXqPRvXdu4,46 on a red bull vid lessgo,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Saludame xd,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Can I join redbullllll pleaseeeeee,
rZXqPRvXdu4,That hurts and it is still fast?,
rZXqPRvXdu4,What is up with sweden inventing almost everything?!,
rZXqPRvXdu4,like this,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Move to Red Bull Ice Cross,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Im the first,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Wow???,
rZXqPRvXdu4,O red bull tinha que comprar o flamengo do brasil,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Big fan shoutout please,
rZXqPRvXdu4,?,
rZXqPRvXdu4,id beat these guys red bull hml,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Red Bull Love from India,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Give me a Heart,
rZXqPRvXdu4,cool,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Verry Good.,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Hi,
rZXqPRvXdu4,ive seen LTT videos with better acting,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Sorry but that was pretty awful editing.. Cool yeah but very hard to watch and enjoy,
rZXqPRvXdu4,Wouldn't speed skating be the fastest sport on ice? Like its there in the name,
rZXqPRvXdu4,"Ice cross is much better than the previous name. If it was me ,I would have called it,  Ice Speed.",
rZXqPRvXdu4,What happened to it being called crashed ice? I like Crashed Ice a lot more than ice cross,
rZXqPRvXdu4,This isn't the fastest sport on skates. Its hard to find data for Ice Cross but in Boston the Men's final averaged about 23.4 mph and the speed skating world record averaged 33.2 mph. That's 10 mph hour faster without the help of gravity. ,
SLYP7PQc6sM,"To all you supposed avid cyclists that are criticizing Elis Ligtlee for her weight, you don't understand the physiological demand of track cycling sprinters, which are different from most other forms of competitive cycling. It is a power sport, not power to weight.  She isn't a very fast runner, sure, but in her area of expertise, she is a champion, and so much faster than her road cycling counterparts in a flat 500m. Don't make the mistake of equating fitness with a specific body type, and don't be an insecure shaming prick just because she is heavier than a road cyclist.",
SLYP7PQc6sM,Please do Micheal Phelps and Usain Bolt???????,
SLYP7PQc6sM,They’re both Dutch just have them speak their own language and add subtitles,
SLYP7PQc6sM,everyone’s saying “oh stop calling the cyclist fat” but i literally see no comments calling her fat?,
SLYP7PQc6sM,Can u do sprinters do long distance and long distance to a sprint,
SLYP7PQc6sM,I can't decide which was funnier cyclist hammering the ground or runner toeing on the track bike lol,
SLYP7PQc6sM,"if any of you want to attempt beat  Elis Ligtlee's speed at your local velodrome, you must be able to hold 39.1 miles per hour for 200 meters.",
SLYP7PQc6sM,"good luck with that, buddy.",
SLYP7PQc6sM,Her:  a distinguished career in track cycling at 23 years old...you?  Watching this video.,
SLYP7PQc6sM,Is no one mentioning the runners arms like I want those ?,
SLYP7PQc6sM,It made my feet hurt when the cyclist sprinted the first time while practicing a heel running technique. It's natural to heel run for most people but it hurts a lot in spikes.,
SLYP7PQc6sM,"All the little English mis-steps were really cute. Like ""I'm going to learn you"" and ""feet"" hahaha",
SLYP7PQc6sM,"For those criticising the levels of fat, do some reading on the importance of fat when sustaining a heavy training program. These people are managed to the nth degree, at least give them an ounce of credit!",
SLYP7PQc6sM,The cyclist runs like she has high heels,
SLYP7PQc6sM,Let a triathlete swap sports with someone.,
SLYP7PQc6sM,These two ladies are adorable,
SLYP7PQc6sM,"These two ladies are just so lovely, I had such a great time just watching them hang out :)",
SLYP7PQc6sM,"First time on a track bike is terrifying so it's understandable, fear of crashing and hurting yourself,  plus the high banking",
SLYP7PQc6sM,For comparison Naomi Sedney has a PB of 7.30 over the 60m while Elis Ligtlee completes the circle in about 14 seconds from a flying start.,
SLYP7PQc6sM,You should do some pole vaulting ? it would be funny to see someone try,
SLYP7PQc6sM,Do mo farah vs usain bolt ,

DloLoFd3Qvw,"Big thanks to the Verge for letting us use footage from a great documentary they made years ago about NFL broadcasts. Check it out here: http://bit.ly/2HYSXFN  And thanks to Phil Edwards for inspiring this video with a piece he wrote for Vox.com: http://bit.ly/2I2iVs8. If you’re interested in this topic, take some time to listen to this really lovely radio documentary made by an audio engineer who works on the Olympics: ",
DloLoFd3Qvw,One of those jobs where people notice only if you make a mistake. Hats off to them working so hard.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,"Audio, the least appreciated department in games, movies and tv as by nature Sound is only noticeable when its done bad.",
DloLoFd3Qvw,"As a audio engineer, I feel the grief of those hard working men.",
DloLoFd3Qvw,Major props to these guys.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,Live audio mixing? That would stress me out beyond belief,
DloLoFd3Qvw,This channel makes me think about topics which previously. I wound not have giving a rats ass about.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,"Don’t care about sports, but this is FASCINATING. Vox is on the cutting edge of excellent documentary work.",
DloLoFd3Qvw,"I thought the title meant like, better in the living room than other parts of the house! I was like ""what's special about a living room??"" ",
DloLoFd3Qvw,Video by Joss! She's awesome and I hope we get more of her ,
DloLoFd3Qvw,"As someone who's mixed live sound, I pay careful attention to the sound of televised sports, but I didn't realize how many microphones were involved. Those engineers are the real stars in my book!",
DloLoFd3Qvw,Must be a stressful job. Kudos to these guys for making my TV experience much better.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,Another advantage that the living room has and will never be beaten by going to the actual games: you're always closer to the bathroom.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,“Why sports sound better in your living room” -,
DloLoFd3Qvw,"I spend a majority of my time on the toilet, sooooo....",
DloLoFd3Qvw,Who else prefers to hear the players rather than announcers,
DloLoFd3Qvw,Joss Fong <3,
DloLoFd3Qvw,also there's announcers for commentary compared to live games in person.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,"I don't watch sports, I don't care much about them. Don't get me wrong I don't ""hate"" them, it's just not for me. This video was awesome though. I love hearing about how pros do things behind the scenes and these sound guys are pros.",
DloLoFd3Qvw,Needs more cowbell.,
DloLoFd3Qvw,Sounds of the game is honestly part of the reason I'm such a sports fanatic. ,
DloLoFd3Qvw,Best sounds in sport: ,
DloLoFd3Qvw,1. Crack of a baseball on the bat,
DloLoFd3Qvw,2. Ball hitting the back of a baseball mitt. ,
DloLoFd3Qvw,“You’ve got some players running around on a huge field” shows soccer,

szeXkBYq5HU,"This is such a cute and sweet song, it makes me remember the way i met my boyfriend. It’s a silly story but he started liking me when he saw me in the “test class”, i was in 9th grade (we have this “+1year” in Brazil)  and he was in his freshman year, but i never noticed him cause i was not friends with the highschoolers. But one day, my P.E class was at the same time of the highschool recess, and i was playing volleyball with my friends when they joined us, it was like a really cliche anime, and my eyes were glued on him, I thought he was looking at my girl friends behind me, cause i’m really shitty at volleyball and they are pretty and very athletic, but in the end he was looking at me. He took my number with one of my friends and we started a really good friendship, and in the last day of school i hugged him and said goodbye, he says this was the day he looked in my eyes and had the certain that he loved me and wanted to spend his life with me, so he confessed to me by message and i thought he was joking so i just laughed and ignored. 2 months later i took courage and confessed to him, but he was in Canada at the time, but he said he liked me back! When he came back to Brazil we went to the mall and we  confessed to each other”officially”, 2 weeks later we met again at the same mall and i gave him a letter saying “i love you” at the end, and guess what? He gave me a letter too and in the end it was written “i love you”. We dated for one year, he broke up with me cause i said he couldn’t love me if he didn’t love himself first and it was the worst day and month of my life, i went to Europe and made contact with him again, just talking to him made me so happy, and then when i came back we hanged out again and decided to try again, so we are back together now and happier than ever :) ??",
szeXkBYq5HU,I’m literally going to buy a skateboard so I can binge on all these songs and just jam,

szeXkBYq5HU,"Not to be that person that is like ""omg this song describes my life"" but honestly rn it perfectly does describe my relationship. He seems so sad and distant, so confusing and I can never read his emotions. I'm wanting more from him and waiting for him to be done with all he's got to do before he can move back close to me. Alot of more of the lyrics really hit home with how relatable they are",

om80Y_V3fhw,I love that Scott is so much taller than almost everyone on the cast,
om80Y_V3fhw,They hit a home run with this one.,
om80Y_V3fhw,Subtext: daddy issues,
om80Y_V3fhw,I never realized how much I needed a Josh Nathaniel duet till now,
om80Y_V3fhw,"""We're American men, we like all sports except for soccer 'cause soccer's just a bunch of foreigners running around, YEAH!""",
om80Y_V3fhw,Beautiful. ???,
om80Y_V3fhw,"Hands up if you didn't get any of the sports analogies, as you're a nerd who doesn't understand sports",
om80Y_V3fhw,i love a good black and white rachel bloom song,
om80Y_V3fhw,"between the pitch and catch analogy and the shuttlecock joke, i think rachel is trying to pitch a new ship",
om80Y_V3fhw,All the love to Scott Michael Foster. He posted on Instagram today that he lost his mother.,
om80Y_V3fhw,It reminds me of the time when Josh said “Sports” in ping pong girl,
om80Y_V3fhw,Omg why are those guys so fit and so great at singing,
om80Y_V3fhw,The two-fisted drinking and smoking is the best thing ever!,
om80Y_V3fhw,"As a gay man, 90% of the lyrics sounds like a foreign language to me.",
om80Y_V3fhw,"I really want to see a “After everything I’ve done for you (Reprise 2)” where Josh, Nathaniel and Greg all confront Rebecca on everything they’ve done for her (That she didn’t ask for) in like a heated finale... That’s the Dream.",
om80Y_V3fhw,Oh whoops I heard sports and allergies ??,
om80Y_V3fhw,Sports go sports! Athletics are number one! get that ball past that thing or whatever.,
om80Y_V3fhw,I can’t wait until season 4 is on Netflix ????????,
om80Y_V3fhw,This sure is a looks at smugded handwriting homerun... goal... strike?,
om80Y_V3fhw,The fact that they're holding a scotch and cigar in each hand ???,
om80Y_V3fhw,"When I listened to this the first time I was like... ok well, I don't care about any sports so this is sorta lame. But then they spread on those daddy issues so thick and I am hooked ahahha",
om80Y_V3fhw,Now I ship Josh and Nathaniel lol,
om80Y_V3fhw,"I still can't cope with the fact we're getting closer and closer to no more new songs, this is brilliant as ever! It also feels quite close to what SMF talked about in one of the interviews when he joined the cast - a classy, band genre. I think he auditioned with Fly Me to the Moon? Their voices work so well together too",
om80Y_V3fhw,"Love the song, but I have to say this....",
om80Y_V3fhw,Sportsball should be a language in Google Translate,
om80Y_V3fhw,Jus finished this episode I was so happy for Greg and then I realized what about Nathaniel And when he heard the conversation Rebecca was haveing OMG my heart broke a bit,

_eaK4DIxB5s,since half of the soccer clips in this video are from the american soccer league (MLS) Im pretttty sure this guys from usa/canada,
_eaK4DIxB5s,"so about 60 hockey plays and the rest are CFL, Toronto raptors and blue jays, very objective.",
_eaK4DIxB5s,Zlatans goal against England did’t even make it... y’all soccer fans know what I’m talking about,
_eaK4DIxB5s,That was the hypest curling play I've seen ever,
_eaK4DIxB5s,Hockey player: makes a goal,
_eaK4DIxB5s,greatest play of all sports,
_eaK4DIxB5s,90% of the comments: something about Canada,

_eaK4DIxB5s,0.1%(me): If 57 is a TOP play of the decade call me a gold medalist,
_eaK4DIxB5s,imagine not including Ray Allen's Game 6 buzzer beater,
_eaK4DIxB5s,"Bro... volleyball has some crazy savings too, should've been in this",
_eaK4DIxB5s,The order of these clips is highly questionable,
_eaK4DIxB5s,They really had to show that Saints/Vikings play that I’m still about...,
_eaK4DIxB5s,Baseball: Wow he makes an impressive barehanded catch.,
_eaK4DIxB5s,Cricket:  (-_-),
_eaK4DIxB5s,Nobody:,
_eaK4DIxB5s,"The Guy Who Nade This: ""lets make the nfl clips keep switching speeds and broadcasts in the middle of the play""",

_eaK4DIxB5s,16:16 - “are you kidding me? he threw that ball from that distance in the air!”,
_eaK4DIxB5s,no shit sherlock...where did you think cespedes might throw it?,
_eaK4DIxB5s,What about an undrafted free agent making a game sealing interception in the super bowl?,
_eaK4DIxB5s,"98 ""what a time to be alive!!""",

_eaK4DIxB5s,Rest of the sports score: cheers goes nuts ,
_eaK4DIxB5s,1 in a million golf putt:,
_eaK4DIxB5s,"Missed out on a lot of tennis imo. There are way more sick moments than the two from Cuevas, and half the ones from team sports were the same play.",
_eaK4DIxB5s,"so many moments that were missed..but that can be expected since this is 90% american sports, they missed heaps",
_eaK4DIxB5s,"I don't know if authors are aware, but in 2010-2019 humanity played more than 4 sports",
_eaK4DIxB5s,14:10 that dude definitely flat packs a kid with that catch lmao,

_eaK4DIxB5s,"I like the clips where someone makes one of the better plays I've seen and the announcer is like ""that is definitely one of the best plays this weekend"" ?",
_eaK4DIxB5s,I've got the best idea ever. Let's make a top 100 sports plays and just put in around 90 clips and skip a few numbers. Brilliant.,

_eaK4DIxB5s,"I appreciate the hockey representation, especially being from the US where it's basically scoffed at by the majority of the population, but there's too many one-handed tucks and not enough dirty dangles. I'm a blues fan and even I think that at least one of these clips should be replaced by a Kane goal, he won more cups than Crosby during the decade (Their wins together make up 5 out of the last 10 championships) and his highlight reel is more than extensive.",

nYRefC7E9gU,He’s a lot more level headed than i thought.,
nYRefC7E9gU,This is exactly what i've always said as the reason you bite his ears. Frustration and being headbutt during 2 fights. Man i felt frustrated for you!

Personally there's no time to stop and ask if someone's okay after they fall considering it happens so often and the game doesn't pause unless you're down and don't get back up. I understand, but it's nice to have people be, you know, decent to each other. I could do without the opposing team calling us names. Lol",

Can you just watch the game, love the music - movie, art etc. No need to put another human on a pedestal to were you need to reach out to touch them or think of them as gods. Lady trying to grab his hand and slip a quick feel on LB is the word pathetic. Hes human, yeah he's good at basketball, but he's not someone to idolize like a god. Kids look up to them like a super hero all good I did too as a kid. Then you grow up and realize he's just another human like you. Only he could give a shit who you are as shown by his no interest in the adult women reaching out just the kids. So why idolize some person that could give two shits about you. Its something I always wondered why?",
