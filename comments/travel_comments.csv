sRyslbdtT90,"Me: Broke , we will be broke"
sRyslbdtT90,Its cheap when you get there but what about flying is that cheap ?????
sRyslbdtT90,"""Beer cheaper than water... Literally"""
sRyslbdtT90,Im glad even travelers noticed that lol Thats my silly country.
sRyslbdtT90,"Montreal isn't the capital of Quebec, it's Quebec City"
sRyslbdtT90,Cape Town 
sRyslbdtT90,Vietnam 
sRyslbdtT90,Ecuador
sRyslbdtT90,Poland
sRyslbdtT90,When he said “I’m Marco” I instinctively said “and I’m polo”
sRyslbdtT90,I love how they showed Pictures of the Seychelles twice when talking about beaches in other countries
sRyslbdtT90,Guys I don’t hear you mention Turkey! It’s bloody cheap!!!
sRyslbdtT90,Cape Town is the most expensive holiday destination in SA ?????
sRyslbdtT90,"12:29 This is the Peles Castle. This castle is in Romania, not in Bulgaria !"
sRyslbdtT90,"12:29 that is Peles Castle in Sinaia, Romania. not Bulgaria :)"
sRyslbdtT90,At 2:18 you mention Krakow but show a photo of Gdansk
sRyslbdtT90,10:57:00 AM
sRyslbdtT90,"That's not Sarajevo, it's Mostar..."
sRyslbdtT90,would you recommend living out of a van
sRyslbdtT90,This is one of the most hyper privileged things I’ve ever watched. Excuse me while I finish this Arby’s
sRyslbdtT90,"All very good ideas, but just one question: what is the Pele? Castel doing in Bulgaria?? ?????  ??"
sRyslbdtT90,"""Portugal, The capital Lisbon..."" first picture shown is of another city - OPorto LOL"
sRyslbdtT90,"Hey from Greece! Cheap island options and not tourist-packed are: Serifos, Naxos, Paxoi, Antiparos and Milos :D"
sRyslbdtT90,Go to Switzerland stay for a week and you'll be broke.
sRyslbdtT90,"12:29 that’s Peles castle in Romania,not in Bulgaria"

sRyslbdtT90,"Don't know about the accuracy of other information, but I'm Croatian so I can confirm that Croatia isn't cheap, especially when it comes to the capital and Dalmatia during summer. The picture you used for Albania is actually the picture of ''the sunniest island in Croatia'' - Hvar. Also, for Sarajevo you used the picture of the Old Bridge in Mostar."

sRyslbdtT90,"Sri Lanka was bombed on Easter Sunday, (3 churches 3 hotels over 300 dead.) Going in July"
sRyslbdtT90,"Basically, EVERYTHING!!!"
sRyslbdtT90,"He said that the best part of Greece to visit are the islands. WRONG!!! I am from Greece, and I will tell you for sure, do not go to one of the popular islands (Santorini, Mykonos, etc.), or to the very popular locations in Athens. They are just super-touristy and crazy-expensive. Go to other places in Greece, there's just so many underrated places in Greece, and the Aegean Islands, while they are very beautiful, are way too overrated. Go to places where you will find REAL Greeks, and REAL Greek culture, and not cheap versions of it sold at a very high price, for ignorant tourists. For example, go to the Ionian islands, Epirus, the many beautiful cities of the Peloponnese, and the ancient sites all over the country, in places such as Delphi, the region of Macedonia, Sparta, and more..."
sRyslbdtT90,5:08 - Sri Lanka
sRyslbdtT90,13:25 - Bali
sRyslbdtT90,SAME PICTURE ?
sRyslbdtT90,"Mykonos killed my bank account, whaaaat!! other than that, loved the video!x"

sRyslbdtT90,Thank you for all the great tips!!
sRyslbdtT90,the way cape town is first but it’s the most expensive in SA????
sRyslbdtT90,you should visit goa in india. it has incredible beaches and one of the most beautiful waterfalls in india. and surely you should visit kasol.
sRyslbdtT90,Sri Lanka=cheap. Bro u rich cuz dats expensive
sRyslbdtT90,"almost at 1 mil guys, good work! I just subbed, hope that that helps"
sRyslbdtT90,why show picture of gdansk when u talking bout krakow?
sRyslbdtT90,"Plane tickets are what make the trip hella expensive. 80% of the budget is on airline tickets ;( [EDIT: umm flights ARE the most expensive part of the trip, especially during peak season and especially from LAX. The only place I can go for a cheap price is mexico or somewhere domestic. Seriously.]"

SL_YBLWdZb8,Hermoso peru.... algun dia espero visitarla??????
SL_YBLWdZb8,one of the most amazing places i have ever been and i still didn't have anywhere near enough time to explore all she has to offer. Viva Peru! <3
SL_YBLWdZb8,Thank you for making the correction about (American) anyone who was born in the American continent is an AMERICAN
SL_YBLWdZb8,I really liked the way you gave us so much information in an entertaining way. Must have taken a lot of research and planning to make sure you were prepared to record that while in Peru an on the road.
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Thats my Country!, keep doing the best documentaries. cheers from Lima-Peru!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,Peru is defiantly high up on my bucket list! I really want to trek the Incan trail to Machu Picchu. I can’t wait to go there once I’m done with college!
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Lima ""Cuidad de Los Reyes"" aka ""City of Kings"". Thnx guys very cool vid about Lima. Cheers from Toronto!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Soy de Perú les quedó muy lindo , los sigo desde hace poco y me  encantan todos sus videos."
SL_YBLWdZb8,i want to visit peru so badly!
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Wow, where have you guys been all my life ?? I am Peruvian but have lived in the U.S. for so many years. When I go back to motherland I bring a list of things I have to eat, it is an endless list though. Great vlog with awesome tips, you guys are the best, I am sure you know that already. I am happy I have found your channel."
SL_YBLWdZb8,"This was a fantastic and informative video! Peru has been on my bucket list for ages, and this really just makes me want to cross it off that list sooner. One of my anthropology professors specialized in Central and South America (so he based many of his lectures around those regions), and I recognized several of the facts in the video. I really love how y'all are not only giving us travel tips, but also providing quite a bit of history on the country and cultures in Peru. Can't wait for the Machu Picchu video y'all are doing with YouTube!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,"My gods. Blown away at the level of information you guys delivered here, and with all the great b-roll to help fill it in. Amazingly done guys. Value packed! Lake Titicaca!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Peru is beautiful. Next time you guys go, you should hike the Inca trail. It was an amazing pilgrimage and one of my all time travel highlights!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,Finally! So happy to relive my memories in the places you visited!
SL_YBLWdZb8,pisco sour ?  is ?  so ?  good
SL_YBLWdZb8,"Im Peruvian! You guys definitely covered Peru well! Can’t wait to see more, #vagabuddy since you guys had 20k subs!"
SL_YBLWdZb8,I want to go to Peru so bad
SL_YBLWdZb8,Awesome video. I spent New Years last year in Lima. Backpacked for a month and did Machu Picchu as well as other cities. Your video is spot on with all the information needed for first timers to Peru.
SL_YBLWdZb8,Proud Peruvian American over here ????? You guys put out the best travel  content here on YouTube and already you are doing Peru proud. Keep up the great work!

bLlPYnz_Rt4,"Could you give me a discount?=I'd like a cheaper price. NO!! I'd like a lower price, a better price, a more affordable price, a more reasonable price, a reduced price. Things, not prices,  are cheap/cheaper. It's a very common mistake. That's why when you haggle, you ask the seller to reduce the price, not to cheapen it."

trmEq3e04a4,"A correction and an apology. Our editing crew were obviously so mesmerised by St. Lucia’s beauty, they let a rare production boo-boo slip through. The notorious buccaneer, Peg Leg Le Clerc, actually settled on Pigeon Island around 1550, not 1950 as stated in the voice over! We’ll let the offenders off this time, but if it happens again they’ll be walking the plank! ; )"
trmEq3e04a4,I am st lucian and I approve of this video
trmEq3e04a4,"I just came from St. Lucia. And darn, I wished I stayed much longer than just a week there. Saint Lucia is full of beauty and grace. Lush rain-forest (I took bicycle tour here), truly glamorous marine jungle (I snorkeled as well), very delicious food, and truly helpful and friendly people. I really enjoyed being in Saint Lucia. I simply fell in love with this lovely island."
trmEq3e04a4,"Usain Bolt said that of all the countries in the world, St Lucia is his favorite to relax....wow. And Oprah Winfrey when asked about St Lucia said, “one of the top five places to see before you leave this great place called Earth,”"
trmEq3e04a4,I’ve been to every island in the Caribbean and St. Lucia is definitely the most beautiful island in the Caribbean. My absolute favourite.
trmEq3e04a4,"It came as a shock to us to learn that although the world has almost 200 countries, only one is named after a woman. Well, if there has to be only one, it seems fitting that it's the tiny island nation of St Lucia. Join us and you'll soon see why!"
trmEq3e04a4,"Thank you, Expedia, for filming this video. I've never imagined St. Lucia is so beautiful! I've just put it on my bucket list. :)"
trmEq3e04a4,I love Expedia. its  another way to travel  world .. I love this channel Expedia

trmEq3e04a4,"We had a great time in St. Lucia, especially 2 shore excursions. My wife and daughter did the Pitons volcanic mud bath. My son and I did an ATV ride along the beautiful shoreline, which included a muddy area. We also got a mud bath ..."
trmEq3e04a4,"Cape Town and now St. Lucia... These are my dream places that I will definitely visit some day soon. Thank you for your great work, Expedia crew. You are the best! :)"

trmEq3e04a4,I'm sold.  What a magical place!
trmEq3e04a4,What camera did you all use for this? It looks great!
trmEq3e04a4,I had what  I have called the best 3 years of my life on St Lucia.  I owned a 57' motor yacht on which I lived and which I operated as a day charter boat.  I had close friends and woke up every morning happy for the new day.  After 3 years I became restless and sold the boat to someone who couldn't tell the pointy end from the square.  He wrecked the boat on a beach .   Bad day.
trmEq3e04a4,Roasting in Phoenix right now as I text..
trmEq3e04a4,It's around 182 degrees I think..
trmEq3e04a4,Me and wife are heading to St. Lucia in early November. 
trmEq3e04a4,"Never been on a ""legit"" island before, so we're excited!"

trmEq3e04a4,??p vãi
trmEq3e04a4,Plz make video on mumbai
trmEq3e04a4,Please make documentary on Nepal
trmEq3e04a4,Any flights to there from Minneapolis?
trmEq3e04a4,I've been to St Lucia and I live in Trinidad.....this stereotypical accent is just stupid.
trmEq3e04a4,My and my dad were born here but my mom and sis come from Cuba and I never got to sèe it but in a whew days I will finally come home and I liked and subbed just because I loved this video I can't wait to see my family
trmEq3e04a4,"I wish more pronunciation practice was given before doing this video, you'll butchered names left, right and centre...geeze."
trmEq3e04a4,"It looks like a tropical Norway, with fjord-like coastline!"

trmEq3e04a4,ñ???????
trmEq3e04a4,"I swear, one day ill travel there. But i live so far away..scandinavia.."
trmEq3e04a4,Is this place pretty safe to travel to as a couple? Worried about ol' Venezuela down south.
trmEq3e04a4,"wow, I had no idea that any of the islands in the Caribbean had jagged mountain peaks like the Petit and Gross Piton!  they make it feel more like something from the South Pacific.  So far I have only been to St Thomas, St John and Turks and Caicos (which is basically completely flat).  so thanks for this great video... St Lucia just took a big jump to the top of my list for travel!"
trmEq3e04a4,Do Tel Aviv please!!!!!!!!!!!!
trmEq3e04a4,who was America named after?
trmEq3e04a4,Unfortunately a stlucian accent wasnt beautiful enough for this video... Thanks jamaican dude
trmEq3e04a4,"Wish, I get to travel to the Caribbean some day. I have never  traveled outside of India anytime. The only exception was a three day trip to Maldives in 2008."
trmEq3e04a4,Paradise
trmEq3e04a4,This island is a gem
trmEq3e04a4,Which resort in St.Lucia provides that 'sky blue bed' in the beach service? How much does the service cost?
trmEq3e04a4,We've visited St Lucia many times . . . In fact 12 yrs running stayed at the Rex St Lucian Rodney Bay made many friends there . . Very friendly and lovely people. We liked nothing better than taking a local bus to Castries visiting local shops/restaurants and bars. Surprisingly I never heard any mention of the Pitons a pair of twin mountains that dominate the skyline even have a local beer named after them. A truly wonderful destination we always went in January temperature was spot on for the Brits but there will always be a shower every day!! Hence it's a green and pleasant land.
trmEq3e04a4,Want  to   no  the  prices  of  rwnt
trmEq3e04a4,Help me! I have not been to the Carribean but I want to.How is St Lucia compared to other islands? How are the beaches and the ocean compared to other islands in the carribean?
trmEq3e04a4,"light rails sunnyvale, cupertino, saratoga west san jose and the commuter trains train tracks and the signals highway and freeway and all of the railroad crossing signals."
trmEq3e04a4,"St Helena, Dominica, Sicilia (sicily),..Some of which are named after a woman, Check it out!!..Great Video though."
trmEq3e04a4,Don't forget Barbados Expedia..It's the gem of the Caribbean sea!
trmEq3e04a4,Hello . Phu Quoc Island VietNams ??????????
trmEq3e04a4,you also show anse mamim when you quoted anse chastnet. about 2 seconds later it is indeed anse chastnet. the resort with the balconies is Jade mountain. You will probably break your spine driving there the road is horrendous.
trmEq3e04a4,could have done without the islander voiceover.
trmEq3e04a4,"This guy said, ""the bitter sweet period of sugar and slavery"" It always so odd to hear how they always have to address slavery in the Caribbean vacation spots."
trmEq3e04a4,"Expedia is largest travel tourist,nicely."
trmEq3e04a4,"It’s crazy how big the states are, because when I read people in the comments saying “I’m from St. Lucia” my first thought was, “oh that’s too bad.” Even though we all vacay there, and it’s some of the most beautiful earth we have. Love my country ??"
trmEq3e04a4,Who else here because of future? ??
trmEq3e04a4,"Expedia are a terrible company , dont use them !"
trmEq3e04a4,The narration was really bad
trmEq3e04a4,Whoever dislikes this video is a pure hater 
u-UA8t2EVpA,hands up if you are IRISH
u-UA8t2EVpA,I'm from ireland and I can say this is the best video made by americans about ireland. usually people will have incorrect information or they will recommend all the stereotypical places that are not actually very interesting. I'm glad you guys included places like Aran islands and Belfast. all excellent places to see
u-UA8t2EVpA,I'm from Galway and I suggest you jump off the top of black Rock into the sea. It's in salt hill on the coast of Galway and it's really fun. Thumbs up if your Irish! ?

u-UA8t2EVpA,"I was just in Ireland for a week driving around the West Coast. My favorite places were probably the Gleniff Horseshoe in Sligo, the Cliffs of Moher, the Ross Castle in Killarney, the abandoned Kilcrea Castle near Blarney and of course the Streedagh riding trip that I took in Sligo. Saw plenty of other places too and loved every minute of it! ? From Dublin we only saw the airport, airport-hotel and the car rental place. ?"
u-UA8t2EVpA,"Just got back from two weeks in Ireland.  Thanks to your wonderful suggestions, we had a marvelous trip.  Rented a car in Dublin and drove counter-clockwise around the entire island, hitting many spots you mention here.  Never would have known about spectacular Slieve League without your video.  Thank you for pointing us in the right directions!"
u-UA8t2EVpA,How the heck do you get so many views? I'm struggling over here. :(

u-UA8t2EVpA,"I live in Northern Ireland about 20min drive from Belfast, here's a couple more places to go to that you forgot... Downpatrick, where you can visit the grave of Saint Patrick under a huge rock in the graveyard at the church. You could go to Fermanagh, and visit the Marble Arch caves and you can row through it, Fermanagh is basically the image you have in ur head when u think of Ireland it's just so green. Another place to go is Newcastle about 30-40 min drive from Belfast and you can walk up the bloody bridge river, get ice cream, play in the arcades, go to cocos (for kids)."

Caherconnel Ring Fort and the sweet sheep dogs...and then there is the spectacular scenary!

DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is mainly for those who simply think travelling is the ultimate goal in life and their main reason to travel is to see all the Pinteresty photos (such as of the Eiffel tower, london eye, etc.) in person, which many many do..."
DWa13rkEUkk,"many travel only to take photos and post them on facebook , so everyone can be impressed. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"i bet if taking camera of any kind to travel was prohibited, 95 precent of people were travel much less"
DWa13rkEUkk,"The problem is thinking of travel as synonymous of pleasure. It is not. Travel is learning, going out the comfort zone, challenging your self and respect the places you are visiting. Going on vacation and traveling it is not the same in my opinion."
DWa13rkEUkk,"The only problem I've discovered with being a traveller is that it makes me overlook the place I live. When I lived in London I never went to do one of the 1,000 things available to me until I showed an American around and realised wow... I live in one of the best places in the world and never knew it!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't understand all this highly emotional indignation of travellers here. I travel a lot and I love it, but I find the video interesting. Travelling is not only fun and beaches and woaw what a revolutionary way to self-development. It has its downsides too, just as nearly anything in this world. "
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem with travel is the cost
DWa13rkEUkk,"What I love about this channel is that these videos is that give a perspective at looking at things which are quite contrary to popular belief. Often consumerism puts us in a trap and we only see the bright sunshine in everything we spend money on, but this is not the case at all in reality."
DWa13rkEUkk,"While I understand you guys were going for a video to try and lower expectations a bit of people who wish to travel, it's also important to point out the good things of travelling. They say 'travel broadens the mind' and it's true. Traveling helps you experience a different culture and opens your mind up to a different way of living and thinking. It's one thing to see a foreign city or country in pictures and movies, it's better to experience it in person. You get to see it all, the ugliness as well as the beauty. Everyone should experience 'culture shock' at least once in their lives to make yourself more humble and appreciate what you have back home."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travel to a place to get to know different cultures, meet diverse people from different countries listen to there travel stories get inspired by there stories and try to do the same. Don't focus your travels on taking pictures to post on social media to impress people back home fundamentally all you are doing is lying to yourself, disconnect from the digital world for a while and connect with the real world and yourself"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I guess I am on the only one in the comments that agrees with the video. Unpopular as this opinion might be, it is true that we hype up the places we go on holiday in our heads. How many times have we said ""the view/food/people/hotel etc etc was not what I expected""? This is not to say that the holiday was bad overall--it's just that expectations never usually match reality. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"I dated many girls when I was single, and came to realize that all girls who were ""travel fans"" and always wanted to be somewhere else or at the beach were just persons who were very unhappy with their lives and traveling was just a way to run from their issues. On the other side you have social media freaks who want as many likes as possible, and a very little percentage of people who truly enjoy other cultures."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Last couple of times I've traveled I felt deeply miserable with myself and i didn't understand why, all was pleasant and exciting, and yet i carried many bad emotions with me. This video gave me some insight as to what the hell was wrong with me. I just feel shitty very often and going to some new location does not change that."
DWa13rkEUkk,This is more real than many would like to admit I believe
DWa13rkEUkk,"This stems from how superficial people are in their daily perceptions, so the problem is in that rather than in travel itself."
DWa13rkEUkk,So you're saying I should just drop LSD instead?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Friends, let's not get the message of this lesson wrong. They are not saying that travelling is pointless. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"In fact Alain de Botton ( the narrator) has a wonderful book called "" The Art of Travel"" and a documentary with the same name, which you can find on youtube. It is full of valuable insights and it is a lot of fun to watch too!"
DWa13rkEUkk,You'll never have this problem if you're too beoke to travel
DWa13rkEUkk,"I highly disagree on this. When travellling, every mundane task seems like a triumph - ordering a coffee in a foreign language, finding your way to a specific sight using only your common sense and a map or vice versa getting hopelessly lost turns into an adventure. And it's amazingly therapeutic, both if you have someone to share the experience with, or if you're on your own and can thank yourself for accomplishing something rather minor."
DWa13rkEUkk,people lost the meaning of traveling / vacation. The purpose is to learn to get ideas to make your place better with the ideas you obtained.  Even the original meaning of leisure time meant to use your free time to learn which so many forgot or did not know.
DWa13rkEUkk,"""don't need the funny moment repeated over and over again"""
DWa13rkEUkk,Yeah tell that to the garbage FUNNY GIFS 2017 COMPILATION/TRY NOT TO LAUGH videos all over YouTube
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is a sad depressed version of travel.  What pictures can't bring us is the triumphant joy and emotion of our own accomplishments in ascending a high mountain or other physical feats.  Those achievements would also diminish all the negative baggage you bring along with you.  Modify the mindset of a tourist with one that pushes your own boundaries - either physically or intellectually challenging yourselves in climbing higher, hiking further, learning another language to connect with people with different cultural backgrounds, eat their food etc... All that would eliminate all the negative boo hoo' s as described in this video. Also, photos can't capture depth and dimensions for crap."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Also, so many of us travelling / flying to countries where we meet the locals who can't afford to do what we do is killing the planet."
DWa13rkEUkk,Well this is depressing
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sometimes travel can feel dreamy. That is until a certain destination's mysticism starts wearing off. But then again at that point, you learned about a new place."
DWa13rkEUkk,"""Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not"""
DWa13rkEUkk,"The other problem with traveling is this feeling when your return home and need to get back to your everyday life, what a sad feeling really..."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I am currently travelling and this video was posted at as a MASSIVE COINCIDENCE as I was contemplating similar ideas. But what I realised was that for me, travelling isn't about always having a great time. It is a time to grow, learn, try new things, get out of your comfort zone, and connect with people and the world around you.. Being in a new place forces your mind to look at everything for the first time- including yourself. I have come to so many realisations about how I think, act and live back home by being away from home. I know that when I go back home I will have come to understand the good things about my life and how I live, and also they parts that I can improve. I have a massive appreciation for everything I have now, and travelling has changed me for the better"
DWa13rkEUkk,I realized this year that I dislike traveling and gave myself permission to never do it again. This makes me feel calm and happy. Great video!
DWa13rkEUkk,"""Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore"". "
DWa13rkEUkk,"""There's no place like home"""

DWa13rkEUkk,"""No matter where you go, there you are"" - Yogi Berra.  Travel without expectations and you'll be fine."
DWa13rkEUkk,"""There's no geographical solution to an emotional problem."""
DWa13rkEUkk,"What an important video. They found a way to exploit our psycological shortcomings, as allways milking the shit out of people. What a great message."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree with this video, based on recent experiences. I cried at Buckingham palace on a short trip to London with my mother, and was inexplicably cranky. At an orchestra festival in Prague my friends and I still complained. Travel isn't a perfect experience, but neither is life. I'm grateful for my experiences, and I think it is still nice to be somewhere new at times."
DWa13rkEUkk,2:44 all of these are still more interesting and relaxing than my life
DWa13rkEUkk,This video proves that if you look you could find problems everywhere
DWa13rkEUkk,"wow, another brilliant insight! never thought of it this way."
DWa13rkEUkk,"That's why meditation is the best form of travel, and it's cheap.  "
DWa13rkEUkk,Don't run away...stay still...breathe...and you'll feel some measure of escape.
DWa13rkEUkk,"""When l get to heaven,tie me to a tree"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Or l'll begin to roam and soon you know where l will be"""
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is so unbelievably pessimistic. As a globe-trotter myself, I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that all a place has to offer is its image. The mere atmosphere of somewhere new is exciting, let alone any quantifiable sensations!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I never expericenced these problems, I love staring at beautiful sights for HOURS, I never regreted a trip. I'm always truly sad going back home though... Seing new places is amazing, but I feel like some of my friends would relate to this video more than I."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree in many points. I love travelling, even one of my biggest dreams is to visit all the countries across the world, understanding that it's likely I never going to do it.  I was backpacker around south America, and the true is that I spent most of my time inside a bus. I was just sitting there waiting hours and hours for the arrival. Sometimes i met bad people (the true is most of the people don't care about you as everywhere) but  i met more good people, who they were a kind of message to believe again in the humanity. The pictures are often fake, the places sometimes are not as beautiful as you see in the picture, but sometimes occurs the opposite phenomenon, you are in places so beautiful that you don't understand why are not they more famous.  "
DWa13rkEUkk,0:14 That's the first time I've heard Goa being mentioned on the internet... ever. I live there. Whoa
DWa13rkEUkk,I actually have so much little anxiety etc when I'm on a trip and feel (and look) sooo much happier. And in normal life I suffer from anxiety a lot. So I guess when i go on a trip i leave some emotional luggage at home and bring my best version ;)
DWa13rkEUkk,"""quiet canal in venice"" shows a photo of the loudest most crowded canal in venice XDXD"
DWa13rkEUkk,I recommend you watch the movie The secret life of Walter Mitty
DWa13rkEUkk,"well, im lucky that this doesn't apply to me one bit :D"
DWa13rkEUkk,I'll just quit traveling and stare at pretty pictures then... As if
DWa13rkEUkk,"""My giant goes with me wherever I go."""
DWa13rkEUkk,I'm still going on on a short vacation in November if only to get away from waking up early and going to work
DWa13rkEUkk,"Wow, whomever wrote his has never experienced truly travelling. I adore the philosophy of The School of Life and their clips however this was waaaay off the mark."
DWa13rkEUkk,Anybody who lets their experiences in faraway lands be ruined so easily is too shallow to travel.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree. You can't escape yourself. I may not live in the prettiest place but when I'm in a bad mood, I see dirt and old houses. When I'm in a good mood, I see the nature, young couples and children. Travel can be great if you want to see all the sides of the place you are visiting. Otherwise I don't care for the pretty pictures of luxurious hotels on social media. And I don't understand why some people see travelling as some sort of greatest achievement in life. I received weird questions from some travelers like, 'Why don't you find a better paid job so you can travel?' Why not, it's a very nice idea to work like a horse at a job you don't like so that you can spend a week or two in a nice place, make some photos to prove you were there and then go back to the job you hate."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Thats why I never ""bring myself"" so by doing that I can have the most geniune experience to fully be there. Rarely take pictures too. I think that everytime you are trying to record that moment. You are anywhere but there..."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I rarely enjoy travel. The process makes me very stressed and overwhelmed. Everything is a struggle and when you've finally managed to feel like you've arrived and get to relax for a day, it's time to repack."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Best thing I've done is to travel when I was young.No regrets at all.To see and experience a new place ,better than a thousand books."
DWa13rkEUkk,"""Bad news sells better than Good news."" Most things have a good and bad side; important to note that."
DWa13rkEUkk,"So true. Emerson said ""who are you that you have nothing to keep you at home?"""
DWa13rkEUkk,2:14 please tell this to Korean television producers...
DWa13rkEUkk,"""We ruin our trips by a fateful habit of taking ourselves along on them."" Tragicomical"
DWa13rkEUkk,"this reminds me of ""Wherever you go, there you are"""
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling is more about your sense of wonder and your love of fellow humans. My travels have inspired me, led me to self discovery and helped me reflect - something impossible in my routine life however blessed it is. :)"
DWa13rkEUkk,I just got back from vacation! hahah So true
DWa13rkEUkk,such a nice and melodic voice! whoever you are I like you!
DWa13rkEUkk,Sounds like you're traveling wrong...
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've been a world traveler and I must say, that it has changed my outlook on almost everything. Yes, I had to bring 'me' along but the adventures were for the most part, wonderful... Seeing His Majesty Mt. Everest ...to Climbing up onto the middle Pyramid, and all the other places ... were much better in person (I'm personifying) seeing, touching.... and experiencing them in front of my eyes vs a postcard. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Shit. I love watching the same scene over and over again. Clearly I'm doing it wrong. Plus, when I went to Rio, I posted photos of the less glamorous aspects, as I came to like them more than sweltering on Copacabana."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video should be called ""The problem with travelling to escape your sad, pathetic life"". Many others travel not as a reprieve from their lives, but for a plethora of positive reasons. Friends abroad. Food adventure. Learning about new culture. Seeing that people across the world aren't exactly different than us, and inspiring ourselves to come home enlightened about ourselves. You can't just tell people traveling is bad when it actually improves our ability to live without prejuduce.  Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness. Could be a good thing for our times."
DWa13rkEUkk,You seem to have a problem with everything!
DWa13rkEUkk,"To me, traveling is highly overrated and very stressful but to each his own I guess."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Kudos again to the School of life. It's one of my favorites and I keep recommending the channel to friends .Wonderfully articulated. Loved it! There were a couple of my opinions which I couldn't exactly find concrete words to express. This video solves that. Also, in today's world with the internet on our fingertips and so many shows and magazines, would you rather watch or read 20 hrs of exhilarating premium content or travel and sleep for 13 and visit actual attractios for 7 hours.. Where also you would end up looking at those waves for much more than a few minutes by the same spot you are on the beach... Think about it.."
DWa13rkEUkk,Totally disagree with this!! Traveling is one of the most awesome experiences for me:)
DWa13rkEUkk,"That's why I take 360 photos to give an accurate image of the location, still I live in Chamonix and a year later it's still stunning"
DWa13rkEUkk,Thank you for sharing! You are extremely talented. I really like to travel as well:)I fairly recently revealed my first ever video - My travel diary in Queenstown. Eep!Would certainly love your comments on my video/editing thus I can also improve like you!
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travelling is amazing. But more often, if you aren't happy where you are now, you also, very likely, won't be happy somewhere else. It's, typically, about mindsets. Happiness comes from within ??"
DWa13rkEUkk,Hubby and me travel alot and we absolutely LOVE IT.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Beautiful Alain, this is a master piece!"
DWa13rkEUkk,I think this was the best video(till now) I saw from you guys! Thanks!
DWa13rkEUkk,"If you tried to discourage me from traveling you failed. I am wanting to explore the world for more reasons than just some photographs. I want to do it to learn other ways of living, broaden my horizons, understand other points of view etc."
DWa13rkEUkk,People who've gone broke traveling: Reeee!!
DWa13rkEUkk,"the more I think about it, the more I realize that up until very recently travel was a scary and treacherous task. I bet people hardly ever traveled anywhere for ""vacation"" I'm guessing it was only out of necessity. what do you think?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Absolutely don't agree. Depends on the expectations ou put on your travel and your ability to express gratitude. Travel can be simple and unexpensive and full of human encounters. How about travelling to work for a good cause. We already know the pictures are part of the business travel and that's normal
DWa13rkEUkk,I just travel to Italy. I'm not interested in 'broadening my mind' blah blah blah....I just want to improve my knowledge of Italian and Italian culture only.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Hahaha I have never seen travelling so depressing. I love to travel, to taken in the culture and learn new things, it's amazing all the time... Go travel it's better than this makes out haha"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I love 99% of your videos. This one felt on the minority side. You have the opportunity to grow within self anywhere you are, as long as it is here / now. Either at home or on a far bussy journey through the Maya market of Chichicastenango in Guatemala on a Sunday morning after being dropped off by a chicken bus, there is always opportunity for growth. The issues you address as downfalls are all related to your mind, not of a new environment. Problems related to expectations not met are just as important for a growth as the lessons there are in a heart break. One must continually engage in self-discovery as the most important journey. But, in my opinion, there is NOTHING comparable to what you learn of and about yourself while traveling in an unknown land away of the usual comforts of everyday life and regular habits. A better angle and more positive to this video, is to value the uniqueness in the lessons of a new trip and the ones acquired through meeting new cultures, new dishes, new methods of transportation, new language-barriers, new handshakes, new mountain hike, new cenote dive, new bicycle ride, new ice cream flavor, new dance move, new friends, new type of fruit, new smile of knowing you did it. And so many new outstanding memorable experience that will linger and outlast in your heart far longer than the life of the cell phone in which you are reading this words right now. Your info could have been added as the footnotes of such message of beware of the many directions your mind can wander while going through your life journey of new discoveries."
DWa13rkEUkk,Who's watching on holiday?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Live, love laugh and travel ?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"BRILLIANT!! Thank you for beautifully articulating why I don't travel. I might also say that  relationships are exactly the same. Reality never lives up to my expectations, hence why expectations are the cause of all misery."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Damn, your videos are so good man."
DWa13rkEUkk,"More new friends, than more pictures."
DWa13rkEUkk,This is an interesting take on this subject. Although I personally could watch the waves for hours
DWa13rkEUkk,I disagree with this view of travel. Seems like whoever made this video just doesn't like oneself. If you're a person who enjoys life & oneself then travel enhances that!
DWa13rkEUkk,I'm so glad you mentioned the Faroe Islands! It's my go to dream vacation but whenever I bring it up people a. ask what it is or b. say there's nothing to do there
DWa13rkEUkk,Some of us might enjoy bringing ourselves along!
DWa13rkEUkk,"Last time I traveled it was a wonderful and near therapeutic experience, since my life was awful at the time."
DWa13rkEUkk,"While some elements of the video felt true to me at certain points, the great moments from my vacation are things that might stay with me forever and totally make up for the unpleasant feelings I had."
DWa13rkEUkk,this is the f..iest video ever from this channel.
DWa13rkEUkk,"travel is the best thing ever, not making t romantic, but it is,independently of pictures"
DWa13rkEUkk,"even not good travels, make an experience."
DWa13rkEUkk,"School of life, you are disappoint."
DWa13rkEUkk,Never leave the house.  Okay.  Got it.
DWa13rkEUkk,This one is one of the best! Trank you
DWa13rkEUkk,Pretty biased video. The other comments explains it well.(N)
DWa13rkEUkk,"Got too dark, too quickly!"
DWa13rkEUkk,This video is so true and great. I agree with it fully.?
DWa13rkEUkk,"""The journey of discovery consists not in seeing new sights, but in seeing with new eyes."" - Marcel Proust"
DWa13rkEUkk,"good video ,,,watching that two days before my holiday"
DWa13rkEUkk,So that's why I never fully enjoyed travelling while I was dragged along with family when I was younger.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Seems like there's really no running away from oneself, no matter where to."
DWa13rkEUkk,Hell I love traveling with myself.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've never felt the need to travel, I've spent my entire life in nyc rarely leaving and feel complete"
DWa13rkEUkk,Well... anyway... I'll keep on traveling! :D I truly disagree with many points of this video...
DWa13rkEUkk,"Yup. Everywhere you go, there you are!I still enjoy travel."
DWa13rkEUkk,Do videos on anarquists!
DWa13rkEUkk,"And more filosophy, please!!!!!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling is the best education and can be a lot of fun! Did it when I was young, but now that I'm in my 70s and have  MS. ""There's no place like home""! I miss traveling and have to live vicariously through my youngest daughter's traveling! She recently went to Venice, Italy, was in Athens for New Years and went to Romania! I went to all those places too, with her via YouTube University's travel department!   Now, I'm an armchair traveler and have been to many different places on YouTube University! I've taken a train trip up the coast of Norway and other train trips up through the Swiss Alps which was gorgeous and in Sri Lanka and India as well. Plus, all the ""foodie"" videos on YouTube that takes one all over the world visiting all the fabulous different  very interesting cuisines! The next best thing to being there! If I'm lucky, I may travel again with my grown daughters by train since I'm not crazy about flying! One has to go through so much more these days with security and traveling isn't so pleasant as it use to be! The size of  most of the cruise ships is ridiculous and people are packed in like sardines all for profit and greed, a sign of the times! Thanks for sharing~"
DWa13rkEUkk,"As they say, the best travel destination is inner self. :)"
DWa13rkEUkk,You clearly don't enjoy foreign food as much as me...bring on my next holiday.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Probably your first video I didn't resonate with though, so keep up the great work."
DWa13rkEUkk,The greatest travel destination is in my head.
DWa13rkEUkk,Travel is good if you do it to expand your horizons -- not if it's used to run from your problems.
DWa13rkEUkk,That thumbnail looks like Puerto Rico hahaha
DWa13rkEUkk,"Thanx for the amazing and eye opening videos. Please do one about pictures of people. the ones they use on social media. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat etc. I believe they are very misleading. I want to hear your thoughts and suggestions on the issue"
DWa13rkEUkk,I'm always happy in Big Sur... always.
DWa13rkEUkk,Swear down that's Terrace from AW at 0:42?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Thank you, Alain. I wish the trend of travel dies down somehow and sometime soon. Global warming is a tremendous threat to all life on Earth."
DWa13rkEUkk,How is this relavent.
DWa13rkEUkk,"There will be 2billion More middle class individuals in the next coming decades. There will be a significant increase in quantitative mass number of individuals with buying power. Superficially that seems great as far as ""bettering the quality of life"" for all. On a planet survival scale this will look like a malignant cancer has gone amok on her body."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I almost always leave myself at home when I travel, I think that’s why it’s so much better than this video suggests. Isn’t that the purpose of travel?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Sad to hear that traveling can be depressing! ? But I still want to go to Australia!!! ???
DWa13rkEUkk,"""We absorb beauty quickly."" That's a terrific thing to know!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"My favorite travel moments are all accidents (about 5 so far). Travel, as this video poses it, is a disappointment if what you want to get is a ""3D version"" of what you felt looking at the picture. It's the same argument SiL makes about marriage: what we "
DWa13rkEUkk,"The older I get, the less I want to travel. I can simply watch a documentary from the comfort of my own home. I can travel anywhere thanks to Google, and the internet."
DWa13rkEUkk,GODD VIDEO TO SAVE MY MONEY
DWa13rkEUkk,I can kind of relate to what you're saying since I'm going to travel to Hawaii next week...but it's for work even though I will only be working about 20 hours for the whole week that I'm out there while I'm out sightseeing and enjoying myself it's still going to be in the back of my head the fact that I'm out there to work and I'll have to budget my time
DWa13rkEUkk,Home with my cats is where it's at
DWa13rkEUkk,"You forget that removing yourself from rote routine can quickly lead to an absolving of those low opinions of self. Breaking routine and achieving those picturesque vistas quite easily helps us realize how little we linger. It teaches us to absorb beauty in stressful moments. For example, when we reach that idyllic quaint cafe, we maycome to find it busy and loud and thusly be forced to learn to appreciate that little dusty picture of Marilyn Monroe in the silence of our mind, realizing no where is necessarily better than our own busy lives. Differentially, elongated silence or being forced to wait when we arrive at that vista we've dreamed us can help retrain the brain to slow down and appreciate the vistas we take for granted at home. "
DWa13rkEUkk,I've known this for a long time
DWa13rkEUkk,Fascinating and insightful view point. The fact that so many people are capable of undertaking extraordinary travels speaks to a fundamental human drive that I believe this video fails to address.
DWa13rkEUkk,Nah the problem with travel is I can't afford it.
DWa13rkEUkk,When asking for support to bring thoughtful content a car alert started in the near by car park. A sign?
DWa13rkEUkk,Talking to a person atleast two decades older or two decades younger is also a form of exploration travel. The essence of travelling can be unleashed when we communicate with that person.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm actually in a good relationship with myself - of course sometimes I'm not happy with what I'm doing, but overall, I really like who I am and bringing myself to beautiful trips doesn't ruin the trip :) - i don't feel the need to put it so tragically"
DWa13rkEUkk,And this is why I like road trips.  To specifically go traveling to be with myself. To embrace who I am while going somewhere I've never been before.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I feel so good to disagree with this video! Well, what a narrow point of view! If you are a tourist, paying for packages and and visiting overcrowded places for a few photos... Well, that may end up disappointing. If you are interested in the culture, of the people, the background, then if it's not that shiny as the postcards say, it still is fine, because it's real. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"To live the place to which we want to head inside our minds is the best treasure. By doing so , ""The Mind"" has already been broadened into another dimensions"
DWa13rkEUkk,:))
DWa13rkEUkk,"I get the point. Sometimes you'll travel to a place on your vacation that might seem so awesome that you think that if you could live there, you'd be happy for the rest of your life. But that's only because you haven't been there long enough to get sick of it."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Well, that was incredibly depressing."
DWa13rkEUkk,Ohhh yes Venice is beautiful.
DWa13rkEUkk,Wish I'd watched this before I moved countries ?
DWa13rkEUkk,The sound effects are way too loud and crowd out the voice over.
DWa13rkEUkk,what about mini depression after traveling?  I'm feeling so sad after I came back from my trip to Germany.. I can't past a day without thinking or dreaming about the trip =(
DWa13rkEUkk,I am both genuinely surprised but grateful that there are so many Indian references :D
DWa13rkEUkk,0:43 advanced warfare map
DWa13rkEUkk,Expat cure for homesickness is simply view a few videos of hometown.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Brilliant! I do not enjoy travel. I always viewed it as simple, childish escapism in pure form - little better than a video game. There is a world of difference between mindless (i.e. tourist) travel and travel with a purpose - to meet friends or family or pursue a career opportunity. Bravo for having the courage to defy the powerful travel industry!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Thanks for a thought provoking video. I consider this quite often, but in the broader context of advertising. I think the same or similar phenomenon plays a role in making us buy something that looks great in the advert, but we completely neglect things like the necessity to maintain and store the item, and mainly, the fact that it's much more difficult to incorporate it into our normal lives."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I remember when I first traveled to Europe from US and it wasn't exactly what I expected it to be, I truly enjoyed it, mainly because of the people I met and the cultural foods I have tried"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Spot on. I remember Russel Brand made the same observation years ago, about the problem that you're still yourself when you're away on holiday."
DWa13rkEUkk,dude I watch those 10 hr beach videos sometimes
DWa13rkEUkk,I dunno . I really enjoyed my trip to Legoland
DWa13rkEUkk,<3
DWa13rkEUkk,"Even so, traveling can give you experiences and lifelong memories that you just can't get at home. It's an accomplishment. Depends what you are looking for in your type of travels."
DWa13rkEUkk,"when you travel, go visit a long lost friend or family member! get them to show you the hidden adventures of a place that can otherwise only be gleaned from living there a long time."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I found travel to be liberating, I was able to leave most of myself and all the worries and bullshit behind, I did take a ton of photos some for aesthetics but some so I can essentially go back but experiencing the ""post card views"" of the Eiffel Tower to reality of the piss, vagrancy smell of the Paris metro was worth it as I got to see the reality of that place."
DWa13rkEUkk,There's absolutely nothing wrong with traveling when it's 50 degrees in your country ?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've been thinking a lot about this problem recently and I'm glad to hear about it from someone else. I've travelled this summer alone for the first time and it was more complicated than I expected, but it was quite an experience."
DWa13rkEUkk,what a buzzkill partypooper! ?
DWa13rkEUkk,"High up on the pine-covered mountain (where I go almost every weekend in summer) I don't typically find despair, anxiety, disappointment etc. Some other destinations I've traveled to didn't disappoint either, quite the opposite. Cool video though."
DWa13rkEUkk,I just travel on the interwebz instead..
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video was brought to you by the Council Against Tourism: ""Do you want to travel? Don't... just don't."""
DWa13rkEUkk,Brilliant insight!
DWa13rkEUkk,Same can be said about relationships
DWa13rkEUkk,Just use Google-street.
DWa13rkEUkk,"idk i like getting myself over to places i feel like overall its a new experience everytime and ive definitely grown more and learned more about both myself and the world. in fact i find coming home kind of surreal as i found that nothing around me has changed, but I was the one who changed"
DWa13rkEUkk,thats why we need a travel machine -_-
DWa13rkEUkk,"I just travelled for months on end and learned much of this very thing. There are peak moments but a lot of the time is dull or absorbed by moods (I'm pretty moody in general). It's not to say that travel isn't worth it. I think the point is more to separate from our expectations and accept what comes. I had a hard time with this but I think now that I've experienced it, I will do better on future, shorter term trips."
DWa13rkEUkk,Our memories do become mere snapshots... by which we judge our lives well-lived (or not).
DWa13rkEUkk,"We can use travels to help us to solve our problems instead of running from them. When you see and accept your problems, travel acquire another meaning."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Goodness, remind me not to take you on my next trip, ALL of which I will enjoy. You are so, I dunno, maybe the Germans have a word for you?"
DWa13rkEUkk,My childhood memories of traveling and vacations are just as meaningful or fulfilling as memories of me and my friends playing in my garage. 
DWa13rkEUkk,It's the memory of a joyful feeling or moment of felt laughter that I remember most and I can have those moments inside my room or in some island in Hawaii. 
DWa13rkEUkk,"Retitle this video: the problem with tourism. ""The traveler sees what he sees, the tourist sees what he came to see."""
DWa13rkEUkk,THIS GUY HAS SUCH A RELAXING VOICE
DWa13rkEUkk,"Generally, I enjoy these little insights. This one however, is total BS!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is something I ALWAYS felt and nobody else ever seemed to feel this way. I always felt travel was more hassle than fun. Because I carried my anxiety, my insecurities, my compulsions along. I am at a better place now. A place where I can enjoy travel for what it is. I don't think this video aims to discourage travel. Just that, it has become over rated off late. And also, we do, many a times, end up torturing ourselves by travelling."
DWa13rkEUkk,"WTH, you need help for your depression."
DWa13rkEUkk,I feel like this doesn’t really happen as much for photographers. Or maybe I just remember the good photos I got.
DWa13rkEUkk,"In terms of personal growth, it seems to me, the best places to travel are those where you don't speak the language."
DWa13rkEUkk,The only problem I've had with traveling is that I love it so much that I feel sad when I have to go back home!
DWa13rkEUkk,There's more to traveling than just looking at things lol
DWa13rkEUkk,It's perspective this seems like a negative way to see traveling
DWa13rkEUkk,"At one point in time this was me to a T. I thought traveling would cure all my problems without realizing that it was never the external factors that would fix me, the answer really does lay within yourself. Amazing work again School of Life."
DWa13rkEUkk,School of Life sell Mugs!
DWa13rkEUkk,earlyyy !
DWa13rkEUkk,What is your problem! You want to run that by me again?.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I have also seen the ""Point of travel"" video from SoL posted in 2015 and find this rather contrasting regarding the perception of travel. This is the first and only post I wasn't able to appreciate completely."
DWa13rkEUkk,Yes wherever you go there you are
DWa13rkEUkk,I think what the video discusses is mostly subconscious.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I noticed that a lot of the comments argue that they travel to learn rather than for vacation, which is different. However, it's still subconscious idea that being at a place in a picture (mental postcard) will be more special in person. Anyone can learn as much if not more from just reading a book. Learning can cost just a few dollars in paperback versus thousands in flight and accommodation expenses."
DWa13rkEUkk,"They totally missed that one of the points of travelling to step away from our daily grinds. Sorry, but I don't bring my mental baggage when I travel. I let loose and enjoy the moment. When I daydream about places I've already been, it isn't a single frame snapshot of an idealised tourist photo-op. The ""bad"" moments are also all part of that overall foriegn experience. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Uh I love TSOL, but can't say I particularly love this video. I barely take photos when I travel. I go to push myself out of my comfort zone and I endeavour to learn as much as I can about other cultures from the inside out. I have found connecting with people on my travels and them sharing their countries with me to be amongst the most rewarding experiences of my life."
DWa13rkEUkk,Sometimes I wonder if The School of Life is an organization run by the government to make us good citizens who just stay home daydreaming of Paris instead of actually going there.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Nah, while I get your good intentions for this video, it is not objective to travel benefits! To my all world travellers; continue to learn, discover and explore the wonders, beauty and mysteries of our world."
DWa13rkEUkk,"To be honest, that replay of the guy falling made it even funnier."
DWa13rkEUkk,"While I still love traveling and intend to do it a lot more in my life, It must be admitted that many of the aspects pointed by the video are true. We idealize traveling too much, expecting to be, once outside your routine, free from all bad emotions and anxieties from our daily lives. This hardly ever happens, especially on short trips.  Nevertheless, taking a longer lonely trip might be of great help to get to know oneself, put one's own life into perspective, and expand horizons by getting to know new people, who have different ways of life and thought."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy the whole travel experience, getting lost, Airports, running around is like an adventure to me"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sounds like a case of expectation vs reality. When I travel, I do it with a purpose, I go there intending to learn something, be it the culture, the social system, the technology and so on. Sightseeing will then be a bonus."
DWa13rkEUkk,"For me travelling is far more than seeing something I saw somewhere before. It is eating local food, hearing people talking their language, looking at the architecture of random buildings and hearing the motor sounds of their metro trains and announcement chimes, which no one would ever mention. Sure, you can import almost anything, but it will never taste the same as the local's."
DWa13rkEUkk,"not true, i travel to explore new cultures and grow my observable universe. try it sometimes ""school of life"", i promise you, you will like it."
DWa13rkEUkk,The USA has all the exotic ethincity if you truley want to expereience it
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think he is just implying that some people (not all) travel as a means to get away from themselves, but fail thinking that traveling will complete them self. Im sure this applies to some not all. Some people on social media post up all of the glamorous pictures of their travels leaving the story of them getting to their destination behind. I probably have a biased opinion because it hits close to home for me and also makes me think about someone awesome that I used to know..."
DWa13rkEUkk,I usually like your content. This time it feels like its not covering the essence of traveling. Its about experiencing something different. That can be pleasant or not in various degree. But if you are open for a different experience its most of times enjoyable.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Seems a one-sided video for a channel known for intellectual exploration. Doesn't travel promote that? The ills of travel seem more environmental, if not cultural destruction, its benefits personal growth and cosmopolitan compassion. Wouldn't count personal baggage among the ills, hardly."
DWa13rkEUkk,There are two types of travelers: A tourist & an explorer.
DWa13rkEUkk,Both traveling but with different mindsets.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Agree completely with what @educatesociety wrote below! I looooove travelling but also know what is to not be able to catch a plain after a stopover on time and having to find a way to my final destination.  Or the pain of what a longhaul flight can be  hahaha. Travel is not a fairytale, it is a great story built step by step on the process. - This video is mainly a reality check, nothing to be mad about."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think the video is speaking to certain people that we have all seen: participating in cookie cutter trips, getting on and off tourist buses to snap photos, always opting for their home country cuisine (or fast food)...etc"
DWa13rkEUkk,I am unsubscribing..
DWa13rkEUkk,This channel is so depressing..
DWa13rkEUkk,Well most people missed the point. 
DWa13rkEUkk,The Art of Travel.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Hmm. Best to travel for the purpose of reframing your perspectives. No routine, no expectations, no responsibilities. Just see where the road leads."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm not sure I agree fully with this. I want to travel somewhere to get a change of scenery and to explore and see what is going on. I want to see different fauna and animal life than the same old, meet different people. As someone who comes from a very small town in an already small country. Going on an adventure is something I dream about and frankly if it weren't for money I would have done so already. Then again my trip would last a year at least and I'm not sure it's quite the same as a week travel."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Yeah, well.. this is a touchy subject. I get what you mean, but that really depends on what someone seeks on her/his particular trip"
DWa13rkEUkk,"If I'm looking for benefits of traveling video, and listening all those banal sayings about traveling, I won't go to this channel. Just saying."
DWa13rkEUkk,learn history so you get more out of your
DWa13rkEUkk,Does this video promotes day dreaming?..?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I am literally travelling tomorrow, now all the excitement is gone. What do I do now?"
DWa13rkEUkk,I know of a place where you never get harmed
DWa13rkEUkk,A magical place with magical charms
DWa13rkEUkk,Indoors
DWa13rkEUkk,Unbelievable you should post this video today...just when i will be travelling...after a couple of years...wow!
DWa13rkEUkk,The most beautiful thing about the places you visit is the people. Sometimes it takes travel to remove yourself out of self constructed confines.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I get the point of the video, but I think it's unfortunate that one would feel that way. It sounds very depressed."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Myself, I love going and having the experiences travel gives me. Truly the highlights of my life are from travel!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I travel for education, adventure, and local foods and music. I've been doing it a few times a year for about two decades now. Never interested in merely relaxing at a beach all day. Those ""hardships"" mentioned in this video are expected, and quite frankly, all part of the adventure. To smack my life out of the routine I'm used to at home. Like anything in life - your mindset determines what you'll get out of it. This video seems to be from someone with a negative depressing mindset on things. Or, perhaps, someone desperate for ""unique"" youtube content?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Of course I'm just speaking for myself, but I find this holds true of my relationships with the people I love too. When I think about a relative or friend I haven't seen in a long while, I often find myself recalling a fleeting happy moment or even a photograph of them I particularly like.  And then when I am finally reunited with them, I can usually only stand about 2 or 3 days of togetherness before I long for my quieter routine."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I find traveling--particularly to nature, as a way to escape the chaos of a busy mind the brews from the boisterous--or even ""boring"", homely routines. It's not necessarily an act of running away from responsibilities, it's more so time given to the self for reflection. Away from the environment where ""life happens"", from a city or a hometown, I think the mind has more clearance to find clarity in what makes me more anxious or at ease. From there, I begin to discover what doesn't work and what does work. I begin to feel like I understand what's going on. Answers are not always given, of course, so it's more so a meditation of question after question, then coming to terms to move on from point a to point b. It's not the easiest task to be in the moment, but surely there are nuances that deter the chance. I think it's a matter of being able to give the self some time for reflection, but also not dwelling to a dwindling while trying to remember the dogma of our experiences."
DWa13rkEUkk,well this is depressing
DWa13rkEUkk,"Depends where you go and your personality. I enjoyed everything about Hawaii. The food, the sights, the beach, you name it. I also loved New Zealand.  But traveling to Bali was disappointing. I have beautiful photos of there but we were harassed endlessly by the locals to buy souvenirs, etc.  There was also garbage everywhere. No matter how adventurous you are, walking around garbage brings negative emotions.  Not to mention India.  Great to meet the people and have wonderful food but most of the time, you’ll be severely disturbed by the garbage and filth."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Um, no. Yes, a lot of people have a warped view of travel because all they see is other people's Instagram posts where they are smiling on a beautiful beach while sipping Pina Coladas, and we are completely unaware of the fact that just 15 minutes later the sunny weather turned to a thunderstorm and their day went to shit, but that is not a problem with travel; it's a problem with expectations from travel. Every year for the past 12 years I've gone on at least one long 3-4 week vacation to a wonderfully exotic destination, and every few months I'll make an effort to go on a shorter vacation somewhere closer to home (Generally continental Europe). Both I and the people I took along with me loved every single one of those travels, but I also realised why so many said that their own holidays were never as good as the ones that I brought them along on. "
DWa13rkEUkk,?????????
DWa13rkEUkk,"Spot on. I now travel by book, cuts out the hassle and disappointment and I can go places I could never afford."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Wherever you go, there you are."
DWa13rkEUkk,So life is truly terrible and meningless? YAY! HAHAHA!
DWa13rkEUkk,"If you travel only to get royal treatment, you will relate to this. But if you want to see the world through your own eyes and have nourishing and not-so-instagram-like experiences, traveling is one of the best things you can do."
DWa13rkEUkk,"“To be a mass tourist, for me,...is, in lines and gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: As a tourist, you become economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect on a dead thing.”"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Q: who prefers (A) travelling cities, dinning, luxury or (B) hiking, huts, adventure ?"
DWa13rkEUkk,instagram.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I call total BS on this one. Traveling is good for the soul, and rarely overrated."
DWa13rkEUkk,"What a load of bull crap...I love to travel, but not by myself. What makes it an enjoyable experience is traveling with my family and friends. Just being with them, enjoying new experiences, eating food we usually wouldn't and getting to relax is why I love traveling. This is such a one sided, negative, and depressing way of seeing traveling."
DWa13rkEUkk,My family's never traveled before.
DWa13rkEUkk,This has to be the most negative video ever. Traveling is the best thing in the world.
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem with travel comes from someone with a very limited perception of what it is to travel. Such a well explained impoverished perception of what life is.
DWa13rkEUkk,I have never disagreed with one of your films more. I can’t see this one as anything but pessimistic and pedantic
DWa13rkEUkk,Please make more political theory videos lol that's the reason I subscribed :)
DWa13rkEUkk,We must cultivate our gardens.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Always loved travel. Probably always will, though the types of travel I enjoy changed as I've aged. My problem with the typical major places type of travel has often been the condition of the places you see. In many cases it's the travellers themselves who ruin sites. Damage, crowds, litter, and nearby conveniences to service them take a lot away from the beauty of the places. Then there is the locals and their government. They both do a lot to neglect or even damage sites with litter, pollution, unfortunate zoning choices, etc."
DWa13rkEUkk,"When I was in the Maldives I felt totally content. No desire to change anything or be anywhere else, it was paradise. When I went to Japan I was 10x more happy and excited that I ever thought I would be. You need to have inner happiness to fully enjoy the external pleasures of life. - Cliche I know but it's true."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've seen that people who travel too much are actually really unhappy, dissatisfied and superficial (not all of course)."
DWa13rkEUkk,Every Weeb should see this video and quit fantasizing about going to Japan.
DWa13rkEUkk,"While this video portrays the writer's view, it is entirely the opposite of my own experiences regarding travel. Visiting a different locale and meeting its denizens allowed me to see life from new, fresh perspectives.  My few journeys abroad have given me unexpected joys and fond memories that will last the rest of my life."
DWa13rkEUkk,"bruh, I'm going to Spain tomorrow "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling is just delaying, displacing problems."
DWa13rkEUkk,The Problem With Donald Trump! ???
DWa13rkEUkk,Alain chill out ! Holidays are just great!
DWa13rkEUkk,stociism helps
DWa13rkEUkk,At 1:37 
DWa13rkEUkk,"It says that ""we absorb beauty quickly and then want to move on."" and once we let the camera linger on one place that would be boring. You guys are wrong, I think that is rather fulfilling, looking at a frame where waves crash constantly even after 3mins in the video. After 3mins in it, we say  ---Ok maybe nothing is going to happen and waves gonna come again and again, and rocks will be still there. And that gives us a sense of relief that its OK life is OK.  Because like in that frame waves come and go and overall things still stay the same, so whatever the shit happens in your life things are likely to stay the same, no big change or something  wild is going to happen, you still gonna wake up the next day gonna brush your teeth gonna take a poop and then breakfast and life goes on. (Unless and until you yourself die or someone close)."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sorry guys, world travel is probably the most important thing anyone can do. It ALSO happens to be the most fun I've ever had.."
DWa13rkEUkk,Please explain your videos in simple English
DWa13rkEUkk,Myself that I take traveling and myself that I bring back are different people. Even seing piles of rubbish on a beautiful beach helps me to grow as a person
DWa13rkEUkk,"ok so stay home and watch pictures! don't seek love or adventure, just stay at home and watch a movie, 'cause they're way better than real life... right?"
DWa13rkEUkk,how did this get on trending?!
DWa13rkEUkk,An interesting point that I would have shared of it hadn't gotten so negative and depressing. Interesting perspective but so wrong to just leave it there ?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I used to love to travel, but lately it's become too much of a hassle.   From the airlines and airports to lousy service at hotels.   Plus there are conmen everywhere trying to take advantage of tourists."
DWa13rkEUkk,Money. Okay everyone that's a wrap thanks for reading
DWa13rkEUkk,True!
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video didn't schooled me. In fact, it just made me more depressed. :( What's the point?"
DWa13rkEUkk,'traveling is glamorous only in retrospect'
DWa13rkEUkk,Almost all clips is made to drag you in depression. 
DWa13rkEUkk," Ideeas, even the voice, is pesimist. Not cool."
DWa13rkEUkk,in other words you can't buy happiness
DWa13rkEUkk,You should make a video discussing the merits of travel as well. Surely you believe that there are some...?
DWa13rkEUkk,What would a school of life video be without half the comments being people who missed the point
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm sorry. Usually I enjoy your vidrios, but this is the one of the few I completely disagree with. I travel for a myriad of reasons not even mentioned here. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"I travel to escape the mundanity of life. Working at odd hours of the day, full time, with so much responsibilities, it is nice to leave behind the world that stresses us out, and relax with time off in a place that will bring us joy. "
DWa13rkEUkk,Thanks too virtual reality we can just appear lol not really
DWa13rkEUkk,There's also the social value of traveling.  Being able to travel to exotic destinations carries with it a certain perceived elevated value of ourselves in the eyes of our peers.
DWa13rkEUkk,Apparently The School of Life can make anything depressing. Cool superpower though
DWa13rkEUkk,"Well, anyway travelling is one of the best methods to go away from problems. Not all people bring their minds fully with them - I prefer to leave all negative at home."
DWa13rkEUkk,Felt anticlimatic walking into SOL's shop in Russell Square.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I dunno, I travel a lot and I've been to 11 countries. Where I am DEFINITELY affecting my happiness. I think that it's easy to think there's a geographical cure for our problems, and some people think they'll be a different human in other places... and when that isn't true they're disappointed. "
DWa13rkEUkk,Am I the only one who's thankful that the speaker doesn't have an American accent? ?
DWa13rkEUkk,"for someone that lives in a extremely conservative country, the best thing about travel is you get away from close minded people, and that, is worth dollar I spend for  traveling and taking photos for."
DWa13rkEUkk,There is only one problem: no money
DWa13rkEUkk,i travel a lot
DWa13rkEUkk,And maybe the gritty or ugly parts of an experience are actually valuable! I don't want to travel and only see the tourist version of the world!
DWa13rkEUkk,I feel like karl Pilkington would really agree with this video.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Love school of life but have to disagree with this one's perspective. It's too negative. Life is beautiful. What is all this doom and gloom, cmon"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm stunned that School of Life made this video. I gave it a couple of runs too, to see if it was an opinion or perspective that I personally couldn't grasp. But no, it's just the opinion of an armchair expert, what he thinks of travel because he tried it twice and hated it. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree 20,30% to .it as travel always makes us happy"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Actually until in the end of the video, i didn't get what is the message really?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Those one or two mental pictures might be what attract you to a destination but all the other hardships that you endure during the trip don't have to be a downer. Embrace the journey and you will feel fulfilled.
DWa13rkEUkk,"No matter where we go, eventuality we will die. Alone."
DWa13rkEUkk,That was depressing.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This seems like a hidden commercial for Virtual Reality devices. I understand that we take our problems with us, but would you give up the experience for just a picture?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is why for me personally, I enjoy traveling to soak in new experiences/history/culture. Not merely for an escape, which I think many people do. City-life is the same everywhere–over time. Baggage will follow you if you don’t clean it up."
DWa13rkEUkk,Syrup anyone?
DWa13rkEUkk,Syrup anyone?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I travel a lot! So, what's being said makes no sense to me at all."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I see quite a lot of comments disagreeing with the sentiment of the video. And I'm thinking quite a lot of them have missed the point of what he is trying to say. Contrary to it being a depressing scenario of traveling, I actually think its trying to tell us in those moments we believe that being there would be a lot better than the day dream, its trying to ground us telling us that sometimes the daydream in our minds our so powerful, that in itself can be enough for us at that given moment, without the longing and (unfulfilled desire at the time) of actually being there at that given time. I think this video is very helpful in again (like all tsol videos) on dealing with what our monkey brains really are. A tool to realize and come to a heavier realisation of self awareness. after all, real self awareness grounds us right?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Umm that was glum
DWa13rkEUkk,"I have to disagree with the view of video about traveling. It is true that we shouldn't hype our travel expectations, that's were I agree with the video; but we should also learn to embrace the experience as a whole, as for many it's not about that one destination, but in finding joy in every moment of the way."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I recently traveled to California with my cousin, mostly because I wanted to skateboard there. I had a lot of fun and it was better than the images I imagined in my head. I feel like this video is good but is wrong because if you travel to do something that you can't do anywhere else you won't feel regret or unfulfilled unless you just had a bad time. Idk if I'm even making sense but that's just what I think."
DWa13rkEUkk,Great video
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travel is the single most overrated ""luxury"", supercharged by social media insecurities."
DWa13rkEUkk,"A bit pessimistic at 2:54. Traveling can change you, even if it's a temporary ""high"" and then go back to the reality of who you are. Could change you permanently for the better too in a small way."
DWa13rkEUkk,Is there a problem with everything?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Actually, travelling is the one thing that keeps you away from yourself, or even makes you come to terms with your issues and helps your inner balance. Absorbing the sights of a place I find amazing is like therapy, and eventually every bland moment of the trip is worth while. The way in which you think outside of a reality you know is relaxed, more objective and much less opressive or anxious than what you are used to."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Somebody explain me the last phrase?? ""Travel magazines conspire never to tell us in daydreaming of the ideal location we have already enjoyed the very best that any place has to offer us.""."
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem is not traveling itself. 
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem is when we see travel as a salvation of our inner problems.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I luv vacation. Paying for it, is the only problem."
DWa13rkEUkk,146 traveling agents disliked this
DWa13rkEUkk,"We travel to escape, but we can never escape ourselves."
DWa13rkEUkk,The Problem with School of Life
DWa13rkEUkk,u r the best!
DWa13rkEUkk,I would double LIKE that!!
DWa13rkEUkk,"I stopped traveling once I realized that humans are big pieces of crap no matter where you are, what's the point of going somewhere if the unbearable stench of humanity is always there?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Henry David Thoreau touched on this problem in Walden; ""I have traveled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways."""
DWa13rkEUkk,"For Walden, the world of his small home town in Massachusetts was detailed and fascinating enough by dint of simply existing, and he felt that true happiness and understanding was found, not by gallivanting all over the world, but by studying the marvels of creation as they manifest themselves right in front of you. For him, the greatest journeys lay inside the individual, and any external traveling was, at best,  a tool for self-analysis, and at worst, a shallow distraction from the inner work that needed to be done."
DWa13rkEUkk,"What an incredibly limited view on traveling. If you travel to a new place solely for the scenery, you're traveling for the wrong reasons. I'd like to think that the reason we have a desire to travel is to gain an alternate perspective - learn about a different culture, eat something you won't find anywhere else, take part in a local tradition of the area."
DWa13rkEUkk,holy party pooper.  I thought this channel was smart.. unsubscribed.
DWa13rkEUkk,Dree Binksy is shaking
DWa13rkEUkk,"I can comepletly agree with this. i photograph very much and i followed many photographers on YT and IG... i ve seen many pictures of them, many all over the world. citys, nature, mountains, people, so many all around. it feels like ive traveled the world already. :/"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't think they're trying to discourage you, rather to make you think more realistically about what a holiday entails."
DWa13rkEUkk,Man what the hell are you talking about
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travel is about the journey, not the destination. Thoroughly disagree with this video."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm a professional photographer that has always valued the memory and moment of a travel experience with people, culture and worldly connection far above any stagnant or moving image you wish to share with others, regardless of how organic or arrogant your intention is with those images. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree with other commenters, travelling in brutal on the mental and physical self, but it does not necessarily mean that it's overrated. You may only get 3-5 second to truly take in an image, of the Eiffel Tower for example, it's only a lure to get you to that destination. No one ever talks about looking at the Tower for the first time, the memories are made from having some champagne with your friends at a picnic below the Tower as the afternoon fades into the evening. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"""The Problem With Being A Tourist"" - that title would make much more sense, otherwise it's just bullsh*t"
DWa13rkEUkk,Dale like si vienes por Recalde xdxD
DWa13rkEUkk,"I have traveled to both Italy and Greece on separate occasions for weeks at a time. I'm from the US. Traveling to those places was unlike anything I've ever experienced at home. Nothing can compare to the experience of tasting cornerstore pizza in Rome, or having a frappe in Athens. These  things aren't snapshot moments, but they're also experiences that would be hard to get in the US. Traveling is a collection of experiences--it's not only a mental snapshot of a particular scene at the beach. It's the beach, the drive there, and the drive ""home""."
DWa13rkEUkk,i travel because i am forced to go. and then forced to repay karma from previous lives lived in those places. im lucky to still have all my limbs.
DWa13rkEUkk,Brilliant analysis. Wholeheartedly agree with the content.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sure the top sights might convince you to go to a place but it's really the reality of a place that is most enduring.  You can experience things good bad and ugly in every moment.  Your senses are heightened, your life experience enriched, and living in Vancouver, I appreciate home more than just about anywhere in the world.  Seeing the wonders of the world, meeting people of different cultures, faiths and socioeconomic levels is important to become a well rounded and 'worldized' human."
DWa13rkEUkk,"These moments of  bliss - sunset, the roar of a waterfall, the first surf at your feet, a smile from a gorgeous person - are part of what makes travel so attractive."
DWa13rkEUkk,"But, there is so much more."
DWa13rkEUkk,"IDK, there's nothing like fully experiencing another culture. Imagining it is not the same at all. I still want to take myself and all my baggage to so many more places while I still can!"
DWa13rkEUkk,It's not all good for the places travelled either. Many 'city-break' cities have become shit holes.
DWa13rkEUkk,"These days you’re made to feel as if traveling is the only thing that gives life value and if you don’t travel, or even worse don’t want to travel people think there is something wrong with you."
DWa13rkEUkk,I mean if you can't see beauty where you are it seems pointless to think that another country will change that... Innerpeace and beauty can be found anywhere.
DWa13rkEUkk,"You think travel is bad, try time travel? I tried it tomorrow and it ain't fun."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I love to travel. I love the airports and the taxis and the food and the languages and all the other people.I've never had an awful vacation like the ones you depict here. But th I s is the only video talk I've had to disagree with, Dr. B. Love your work!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This should be titled, ""How Social Media Ruins Travel""."
DWa13rkEUkk,https://www.facebook.com/DreamofChile/
DWa13rkEUkk,"I would disagree. I think the average human is intelligent enough to realize what they like and what they don't like about traveling and thus there is a transition away from tours/packages etc. and more towards independent traveling. As for living for the moment, I believe if you've travelled enough you accustom to the negative stuff and so enjoy the 'unsulllied views' more. Finally, all these emotions surrounding travel (anxiety etc) everyone experiences and continues to experience whether it's their first flight or hundredth. That is the beauty of travel, to get out of your comfort zone and it's what helps shape us."
DWa13rkEUkk,"we all know approximately what to expect from our travels, there are ugly things too, and we are not so naive."
DWa13rkEUkk,i think this video is a failed attempt to comfort people who can't afford travelling.
DWa13rkEUkk,This is why I never stay on a resort when I travel. I have been to Mexico 2 times within the past year and both times I stayed in an Air BnB among the locals. I loved it. Trying street food and mingling among everyday Mexicans was the best part aside from the beaches and visiting the Mayan Ruins.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Hmmmmmmmmmm.......... I'd say this is the type of traveling that I sneer at when I see other people doing it, or which I suffer through when I'm on a big group trip. But me on my own exploring someplace new? Not like this at all. There is beauty everywhere!"
DWa13rkEUkk,I went to Mexico last year and had no idea what it was like before hand and took no pre expectations. It was a great holiday.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling, being on the road, in a plane, on a boat, is for me such a pleasure. I always discover what is really important in life by being in a foreign country. I always learn something when traveling trough horrible and beautiful places. There is a downside of course, planes do ruin the environment."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Personally, it's not the insta-worthy views that make me love travel; it's all of the little incidental discoveries about the worlds of other people. There are few greater joys than that of walking around a foreign supermarket and marvelling at the weird and wonderful packages."
DWa13rkEUkk,Google earth is the cheapest way to travel
DWa13rkEUkk,Rip
DWa13rkEUkk,I don't like his voice it's weird and it gives me headaches change him
DWa13rkEUkk,"I enjoy this channel, but (personally) I profoundly disagree with this. I want to see all of it.  I want to learn about what places are really like. I do tend to leave my mental baggage at home. Anything I can't fix or work on during travel, I forget about.  I even enjoy the back of the taxi cab driver's head while I ask them about where we are and where we are going. I have time to read for enjoyment while on that plane with the stained seat back.  That being said, I tend to gravitate toward new people (and food!)  -- not tourist destinations when I travel.  I do believe the richness of my enjoyment is through learning and novelty though. So returning to the same place is never a similar experience.  I try to enjoy those mental pictures later for what they were.  And I recognize I wouldn't necessarily like living somewhere I love travelling."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I do understand that people bring themselves along when they go to a new destination, but overall I don't agree with this video at all. Travel is so much more than a picture or imagining a nice place, travel is all about the experience! The food you try, the new people you meet, the similarities and differences in culture you find, the ocean wind on your skin, not knowing what you will see as you turn a corner! These cannot be imagined, and they help you see things subjectively again and see yourself outside of your daily life. It's a great way to self discover and also spend quality time with loved ones..."
DWa13rkEUkk,Yes. Never travel. Live in North Dakota FOREVER
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling, to me, can be one of the most enlightening experiences ever. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to break a bank all the time. Your own home country may surprise you a whole lot. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"If you venture out to further away places, however, your experience will never be the same as how you see in advertisements, you should always seek for the good in the bad in every place. Traveling should be more about learning and seeking something different rather than always expecting something better."
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem with Allain De Botton
DWa13rkEUkk,"School of life videos should have a spoiler alert. Like for this one ""If you are going on a trip and already bought the tickets don't watch this video."""
DWa13rkEUkk,"If you will not travel, I will. Help me travel?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Quite true video.Travelling is amazing if it is for a short period and as long you enjoy the differences,you are already leaving them. Travelling for months is a horror trip,with just a few highlights. Always the need to find a good hotel ,a place to have breakfast ,to find the attractions of the place, walking around till you are exhausted just by searching things,.....I'm happy that I have a home again and I will just travel for a super short time in an organized good hotel."
DWa13rkEUkk,Should I not go then?
DWa13rkEUkk,I travel all the time out the country and never regret any of it.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is not a problem with travel, it's a problem with being a depressed self-loathing victim."
DWa13rkEUkk,"It was when I was a teenager that I realized whirlwind trips where you whisk yourself from one attraction to another would be virtually meaningless to me. So I determined that I would, whenever possible, try to spend an extended amount of time in a locale. That way I could really observe & absorb a culture. That's how I wound up staying in New Orleans for several weeks and lived in Cork City, Ireland for a few months. It's why I've stayed for months at a time in Seattle & in Georgia, etc. Not everyone has the luxury to travel like this and I rarely do anymore, but I'm so glad I did when I was younger. It gave me greater empathy and understanding, to see and experience how people really live around the U.S. and beyond."
DWa13rkEUkk,Superb
DWa13rkEUkk,I completely disagree!!!
DWa13rkEUkk,I really don't agree with this. I see where you're coming from but it just seems like you're trying to find the bad in everything. I have experienced bad things while traveling but they have just contributed to the experience
DWa13rkEUkk,As someone who loves to travel: nothing in this video applies to me. There is no problem with traveling. Get your ass out in the world.
DWa13rkEUkk,Heníal
DWa13rkEUkk,"as much as i agree with some comments that stated this video is somehow-sad; i think this video also have a point, and it's already pointed out by the title ""the problem with travel"" this video already stated it wanted to pointed out the PROBLEMS, the negative sides of what traveling may have..."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Well this video would have been full proof if he had offered hints to solutions on how to ensure you have a ""decent"" time while traveling"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I mostly agree with this video. I have traveled to 14 countries, the travel experiences that I have enjoyed most have been to places where I have done no research on an didn’t expect anything. Traveling is linked to the atmosphere and energy of the surroundings... for many people traveling is quite stressful, they struggle with the “ not knowing” how and where. I feel like it’s a bit of a mood killer and people carry all  that frustration with them on the trip. We run a travelblog and we post pictures not for showing off but because we have realized that pictures do motivate people to go an see... to go and travel and our hope is that they too will learn the lessons that we have and that it will help them be more sympathetic and compassionate to other cultures... unfortunately I do realize that to some it is only about the view and capturing the picture, everything else is an annoyance in between. This makes me quite sad but this realization will help me to become a better blogger from now on."
DWa13rkEUkk,"The best part of the video are the comments. Where does it hit you guys so hard that instantly you came up to type ""That's not true! My life goals are not invented by somebody else!""? Is it traveling another artificially invented need by our economic system? Like a mate just told me ""I want to go to India for a month to learn how to meditate"" Dude, you can learn it at home like now! The video is right: you can never run away from yourself."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I dont get it. Is this video supposed to tell me that its no good to travel or is it the first step into how to become a better traveler? Where you leave off, as well as the title of the video leads me to believe that its the former. I'm sorry Alain, but this is just as bad as the temporary escapist fix you criticize.. If you really want to school us on life, I'd change this to a multi part series on how to become better travelers.. what perspective to take and what to do on a vacation. There's too much to throw away by writing off travel. Understanding is not the same as experiencing, you need both."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I disagree with this video. I don't travel with grand expectations. Also it's the mundane things, like walking down some crummy side street in another country that make the experience varied and interesting."
DWa13rkEUkk,"School of Life is looking at it from one perspective, to me, its a perspective of a person who rarely travels. I think people know that travelling arent always what they expected, especially visually. However, travelling is not just a visual tour, i think its more of a cultural experience, especially when going to a differnet country. Money and experience are most often related. I think people travel to places they want to, not just for the sake of it. Proper travelers are sometime encourage to learn a basic language, or culture, history before hand, to really respect the time you have in that city. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"i was aware of this for one trip. i didnt let it bother me, but it did creep up to me HARD at the end.  "
DWa13rkEUkk,"However, my last vacation trip was sweet and simple, and remembering that other trip, i was prepared for the inevitable. mental & physical prep is what it is. youll let them go and just enjoy the now."
DWa13rkEUkk,I agree with this so much I'm shocked at the amount of disagreement in the comments. 
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travelling is heavily curated and filtered in our digitally dominated lives with modern technology. We see pinterest photos of picturesque shots from professional photographers in a good weather. But the reality is that the photographer had to brave the windy landscapes in the cold for days just to wait out a good weather that lasted for 10 minutes just for him to get a shot. At that point, he was already sick of the swaying grass and the crashing waves. He just wants to go indoors and enjoy a cup of hot chocolate. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"sometimes I wonder what this guy has gone through that makes him see everything in such a negative way ...I mean yes, some things of course are more depressing if you think about them more objectively but I don't think travel has to be one of those things. He must've had some really bad experiences because my travels have more often than not been relaxing, therapeutic, sometimes eye-opening and a few times even life-changing. To me it's not so much about looking at pretty places (which is not to say that it can't be part of a great experience) but more about getting out of your daily routine, meeting new people and gaining new perspectives."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I traveled the world when I was younger just to learn about new cultures and broaden my horizon. I value those memories. Nowadays I leave the city once a year and head into the desert, just for solitude. But in a nutshell, it's good to be the best ""travel companion"" you can be on your journey, the rest is just geography. No matter where you go, you always take yourself with you."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I used to enjoy listening to the opinions in the channel's videos, but the more I watched, the more I felt that they are made by very depressing individuals who never get to just enjoy life as it is because they think too negatively. It is sad, really."
DWa13rkEUkk,Completely disagree with all of this
DWa13rkEUkk,Idk if i agree with this one
DWa13rkEUkk,That is a very very very loud camera.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I see the video more as an advise against ""sightseeing"" where you just go to ""the place"" and tick it off of your list. By coincidence is came just back from Japan where I found this great quote by D.T. Suzuki (the guy who introduced Zen to the west) :"
DWa13rkEUkk,"""We must remember when traveling is made too easy and comfortable, it's spiritual meaning is lost. This may be called sentimentalism, but a certain sense of loneliness engendered by traveling leads one to reflect upon the meaning of life, for life is after all a traveling from one unknown to another unknown. """
DWa13rkEUkk,"You'll feel a lot better if you travel by motorcycle. I don't know why, but you will!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've often thought that the main problem with travelling is that it stunts your life at home, specifically if you're aspiring to accomplish something better (e.g. career improvement, fitness via consistent exercising, working on your passion, etc.)."
DWa13rkEUkk,So what he is saying is to never leave you're house
DWa13rkEUkk,Is Alan a pessimist?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I am sure, this doesn't work for me and most people I know. Does that mean that I have surrounded myself with some strange optimistic aliens, I don't know?"
DWa13rkEUkk,that why you travel... then get loaded.  SIMPLE.
DWa13rkEUkk,Never realized how egocentric the people in this comment section were.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Here come the ""I am traveller not a tourist"" crowd"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I really liked the analogy between an experience of beauty and a joke. I agree that an image or setting of beauty can be absorbed quickly and then can become redundant rather soon after. However, in terms of the value of traveling, although we cannot leave all of our baggage at home, I believe that leaving the familiarity of our usual settings and venturing off into new areas and experiences can help distract us and reduce our baggage for a little while. Even if only for a little, I still want any beauty that can make me feel more alive."
DWa13rkEUkk,"The key to enjoying travel is to seek out places that allow you to exercise those same passions and hobbies that make you happy in your current piece of real estate.  In my case it's long distance running, hiking,  cycling. As such, all my vacation spots revolve around pristine off the beaten path destinations that allow me to do exactly what I enjoy doing at home. You'll never find me in Paris or Thailand meandering about like a herd of cattle with tourists."
DWa13rkEUkk,Pourquoi avoir montré ces images de Paris ? Ce n'est pas partout comme ça..
DWa13rkEUkk,They don't understand why proper travelers travel
DWa13rkEUkk,Pointless
DWa13rkEUkk,Now i am certain i am in a Truman Show.. haha
DWa13rkEUkk,The narrator's voice is so soothing.
DWa13rkEUkk,1st video where you guys were so wrong.
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem of travel is CLIMATE CHANGE!
DWa13rkEUkk,You can make traveling an adventure. Your make your own path. Your video is a downer
DWa13rkEUkk,"Theres a saying that goes "" To bring out the best of ourselves  sometimes we have to bring the best out from others"". When you travel to foreign places, try to make friendships with the local people. Talk to the lonely wanderer, a shop owner, the waiter, the cook, the lobby receptionist in a hotel, etc. Spark a conversation, something brief and full of clever conversational topics. Along the way there will be someone who will reciprocate back with the same enthusiasm to establish a lasting friendship. Thats the true key of having a meaningful adventure. Thats  what I always do with my guests."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Did not agree with a single thing this guy had to say. I usually like his videos, and they always seem to be thought provoking, but this one was just BS"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Didn't factor in skiing holidays. I never feel let down after a winter trip doing something I love that I can't do at home... So you didn't factor in the amazing thing you get to do on holiday? Or what it FEELS like to go scuba diving, swimming in the ocean, being on top of a mountain, tasting foreign food or visiting a beautiful Cathedral. It's obvious you're not going to enjoy ever second of the holiday but it's the things you don't know to imagine which make it amazing and what you feel. Daydream, as you said it a picture but in your daydream don't you also imagine how you feel in that setting? So surely it's not travel that's the depression bit but a daydream not meeting your expectations or matching the feeling you assumed you'd have? Meh. 2 cents."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Always good flims here, only the volume of BGM is too high........"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I really don't like the message of this video, you're basically saying; ""you'll probably be disappointed if you try, so why try?"" what an absolute downer. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Being an utter romantic myself with bouts of escapism, I can say that I whole-heartedly disagree with just about every point you make in this video. I enjoy the downtime, the sitting around waiting for something or someone, I'll be doing it anyway, so why not do it while I'm going somewhere. Somewhere where I'll be creating beautiful memories, or ugly ones, but most important of all, I'll be creating memories."
DWa13rkEUkk,Totally disagree on this one.
DWa13rkEUkk,"If travelling doesn't exceed your expectation you're doing it wrong, or your expectation were wrong."
DWa13rkEUkk,Sounds like you're not doing it right.
DWa13rkEUkk,There is so many places of India.?
DWa13rkEUkk,"""The problem with xxx"" --> Get us depressed about whatever xxx you chose. ^^ Careful, the lesson you suggest is either ""stay put and don't even try"" or ""enjoy what you can while you can cuz the world isn't really that great"". Realize that's highly down-dragging? I hope ppl don't understand it that way, but some might..."
DWa13rkEUkk,Just don't go to vacation. Have an adventure.
DWa13rkEUkk,Travel doesn't always fill a whole. I travel close to home and far away. And the moment I'm home I'm depressed again.
DWa13rkEUkk,But what about the food
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is a pretty sad take on travel.  Seems like someone whose spent their time taking many photographs themselves and didn't feel satisfied, therefore felt this is the conclusion."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I will say though, I do take less and less photos from my first trips overseas.  I could never do the vlogging that I see people do, it seems like their whole trip is work.  Thinking of what pictures to take, when to take a video and less on actually just enjoying the experience and local."
DWa13rkEUkk,What I get from this video is that you can't travel because you think the grass is greener. 
DWa13rkEUkk,"Your surroundings aren't your problem. You are the problem, one that you can't run away from."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think this video is not for it's subscribers but to the layman who have not embraced philosophy or dismiss thinking as a pompous worthless act.  The comments seem to echo those that are a little ""wiser"" and already understand this video on a subconscious level.  "
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is not to discourage travel, but do so more wisely."
DWa13rkEUkk,Rampant travel is also causing serious environmental damage. Why not stay home for a week and get to know your own town a little better?
DWa13rkEUkk,What i regret the most from travelling was that I didn't know the places enough. And no you can't just get to know the places if you don't have a local with you who you can trust. Everyone is trying to get your money especially in popular places. Next time I will read a whole library of books and learn the language beforehand before I enter my next desitnation
DWa13rkEUkk,"I traveled to China. I saw people, landmarks, bought goods, and ate food. I could have saved $$ and did the same by not traveling. Traveling is a mental escape for people who need it."
DWa13rkEUkk,"actuallly in this video is ot descrbing even what does it mean to live abroad , with no barriers  , no limits , no certain future , just a road. In this Video alan seemms to describe Tourism , the bad copy of travelling. Anyway it must be undelrine that most of the backpapaers do not travel for pictures (the example isthat me or a lot of my friends had never even bring a camera witht hem -- memories as ten wys better and stories ten times funnier than pics ) an that the reality is that you start living abroad because you are damn tired of living in a shell mad ebut someone else for you , a shell that could trap you for all your life. When i left my home town in Italy three years go (for not returning anymore ) my mother asked me why i was doing so , and the only answer i found is that i cannot waste the only life i had just for making cash and accumulate things. In my deep when i see tourism i  laugh to their constant and continuos arrogance when they arrived in a country (this is even what hte video pointed out ) but i think that cosider this attitude as general is way misleading , as all these arrogant bitches are just a part very small of n era i which thousands if not billion of people is living abroad with no direction home or even wiht nothing more than a bag in their back. Long lives Hobos , death to the damn capatlists (and specially tot heir fucking picures )!"
DWa13rkEUkk,your defination of travel is based on social media.....
DWa13rkEUkk,You can't imagine the taste of Korean BBQ. Off to LA it is.
DWa13rkEUkk,Bring ourselves along? Well maybe there is a choice. Bring no-self.
DWa13rkEUkk,"My god traveling is pushing yourself in situations you never thought you'd be placed in when you're back at home. Getting to know different cultures, immersed in different languages, getting outside your comfort zone, recognising your lifestyle isn't the only way to live, etc my god travel fills the soul."
DWa13rkEUkk,An overly analytical and psychological examination of travel. There are benefits to a well thought out and planned vacation.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I disagree. Just the feeling of leaving your daily routine behind is a good enough reason to travel. I don't get bored in a beautiful surrounding. Most of the time, when I travel somewhere beautiful, I drink up the beauty like a dry sponge, sitting at the beach, in the mountains, in the Ryokan etc. for hours. It fills me up with energy that I can live off for a long time when I'm back home. Seeing the ""ugly"" sides of other places keeps us open minded and makes us appreciate our own comforts at home. Sometimes, when you're busy hiking in nature, or lounging by the pool with a nice, cold cocktail, your baggage can actually become a bit lighter and it has happened several times for me that I managed to resolve an issue I had, just by clearing my head on a stormy beach. If people traveled more, maybe there would be a little less prejudice and hate between all of us."
DWa13rkEUkk,This is pure crap. I have been traveling a lot lately. The truth is it fine tunes your mind and body.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Here's my take on travel. I think traveling is done more to benefit and satisfy one self, more so than care for the places visited, like for selfish reasons you might say. Pictures of places you visited are like trophies to show off. We travel to feel special and receive attention.  When you're a traveler and guest, you are treated nicely, but if you were to live next to or with those same people everyday, it would be different.  Also, the many popular and great places you want to see, are ruined by hordes of tourists just like you wanting to see them. Happy travels!"
DWa13rkEUkk,The hordes of people gathering in mass at tourist trap locations all engaged in taking selfies at every turn to BS over to their friends and acquaintances. No thanks!
DWa13rkEUkk,"Well, this sounds very superficial. I understand that many people just want their 'selfies'. But I feel sad if you think a beautiful shot is all there is to visiting a place. Understanding new cultures, the history of how a place came to be and is different than yours, experiencing nature with different elements that you are used to, etc. And what about sharing moments? (I don't mean a post online, but actually sharing an experience with another being) What about getting new perspectives on your opinions, values, and life goals? If that is not worth traveling for, I do not know what is."
DWa13rkEUkk,"All true, yet far too pessimistic, and without recommendations or remedies - it sounds as if just staying home is the only possibility. Yet some of my most memorable experiences have been while traveling. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Assuming that we dislike ourselves! what a big assumption to make. I think many people seek many things from travelling, but not to escape themselves."
DWa13rkEUkk,Problem solver : Use Couchsurfing and exchange ideas with locals.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Actually for me seeing more just clichees is better. More, enjoing the road and the travel itself can bring experience that no one can take it from you."
DWa13rkEUkk,This people can find what's wrong with everythingggg
DWa13rkEUkk,"a bit negative image of oneself! also, while travelling people often leave behind many of these flaws and become a lot more loose and fun. When visiting people you met while travelling in their normal habitat, they are often not as fun at all."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is why I always despised traveling somewhere for 1 week or so. I rather go somewhere and live and work there to and learn the culture and make friends for a year at least.. 3-4 if I can. been doing that almost all of my life. I don't belong to one country, I belong to many. And I will continue this journey. I love people, and cultures, and above all... I am learning a lot about myself."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is one of my favourite pieces you've ever done. I used to travel when I was younger, long trips to far reaching places. But I don't yearn for a ""vacation"" like that anymore. Being on an actual trip like that is not all its cracked up to be, and its so expensive to undertake such travel. I still go on trips locally, drive a few hours to a camp site, or take the ferry to a different city to visit family, but I have no ambition of traveling further than that. I find too when the people around me talk so wistfully of the vacations they want to take, I feel very alienated. I smile for them and say ""oh yeah, that sounds nice"" but secretly I think they're foolish and have been tricked by the travel industry. The world is a wonderful place, but I'm excited for a future where its easy to see it in VR from the comfort of my own living room."
DWa13rkEUkk,this is so not true!!!!!
DWa13rkEUkk,"To be honest, I didn't understand this video at all."
DWa13rkEUkk,The human condition has urbanized and obstructed over whatever destinations I've dreamt as a child
DWa13rkEUkk,"To travel is not to escape reality, but to experience it."
DWa13rkEUkk,Millions of people have emigrated from their homelands in the search of a better/different life. Travel is not just about taking a vacation.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I mostly go to local attraction precisely to sort out certain mental problems. To revitalize, to step back and to recollect myself."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I've been traveling for over 3 years now and the only major problem I have, is how shallow it is. Unless you live in that country or city or town, you never really discover how it truley is. There are many benefits to travel that arnt explained in this video but depth is on occasion one aspect of life I do miss, which is why i try and visit (or perhaps live) in a place for as long as possible, absorbing and understanding as much as I can."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Traveling is so overrated its a hassle & if you're on a plane in economy ""cattle class"" for long hours its bloody torture. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Then there's unfriendly airport staff, pushing & shoving, long lines at the airport, then when you finally get to your destination...long lines to get into the museum or whatever you're into etc.. etc... "
DWa13rkEUkk,I really don't get the point they're trying to make here. I've been traveling around the world with my wife for 6 years and I can't wait to get back on a plane and go somewhere new. Traveling is by far my favorite way to spend my hard earned money. There's nothing like discovering something new in a place you've been to before. You only get one life so see as much of this world as you can!!!
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think it's important to distinguish between (to simply put it) an all-inclusive two-week holiday and actual traveling. When you really travel for longer amounts of time, you allow your surroundings to transform you and you allow yourself to adapt to your surroundings and go with whatever happens. On top of that there's also a difference between simply looking at something for a few seconds and taking a photo, and taking the time to really take in a view, to explore an area and to challenge yourself both mentally and physically. As a backpacker I can tell you that the 'real' problems (definitely type first-world) are that you always end up spending more money and time on little things because e.g. you can't buy products in bulk and you constantly have to pack/unpack/repack your luggage to make it all fit. And all of this is entirely worth it <3"
DWa13rkEUkk,I think one of the problems with travel may just be how much it cost. Of course a lot of people look at a picture and they think it's going to be amazing without doing their background research. But if you know where you're going then it's a great adventure and a great chance to explore the big world around you
DWa13rkEUkk,"A good idea, but as someone who travels, I regret nothing about my travels. I have learned a lot and grown as a human because of it. My one question is; If you're correct, then how come I want to go back to almost every place I've been?"
DWa13rkEUkk,I think if anything this is a reason why travel is important. There's far more to the world than the picture perfect view
DWa13rkEUkk,on holiday now and this couldn't be more true
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is hilarious. Trying to be introspective as if everyone is the same. As if staring at the back of a plane seat isn't worth it... I spent 28 hours traveling to Thailand. I'd be the one to tell you how much it sucks. But it doesn't. Add an American accent to this guy and nobody would listen. This is not thoughtful, it is single minded."
DWa13rkEUkk,Many psychopaths watch this channel.
DWa13rkEUkk,You usually make good points and have good arguments but I don't think you did in this video at all. You have mundane moments and less than perfect scenes where ever you are including your hometown. You travel to experience something different which is usually pretty great if you go to the right places.
DWa13rkEUkk,"it was doing fine until the last bit. Be what it is, but I can't visit the NY Natural History Museum without going to NY, doesn't matter the rude guy in customs, the non English speaking driver, the long lines.... Not every time the best part is the expectation."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I completely disagree with you for once. I have spent the last two months in Hamburg and it is by a mile the best thing I've ever done. I've met new people and had great experiences with them, I've seen some amazing sights, I've learned a lot about the city and Germany generally, I got really close to the friend I came with. And here's the thing, it hasn't all been good or easy, it's been incredibly challenging and I've fucked up on multiple occasions, but every time something went wrong, my character got built up a little bit more. I'm now more confident than when I came, I'm a better problem solver and overall I feel a better person because of this trip. And absolutely none of this personal growth would've happened if not for travel, nobody ever says ""oh remember when I watched that episode of friends for the 5th time?"" but everybody remembers their experiences while travelling."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is very interesting, however, a little bit of a oppressed way to look at travelling."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm a full-time traveller currently working whilst travelling all over Australia and love ""most"" moments of it, I say most because you can't love every moment but that doesn't mean those moments aren't valuable."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Actually, there is another completely different way to see this: the success of reaching a new destination, to experience another culture, its flavors, customs and seeing things that you have never seen before in your life, can easily take over any thought; because it is a situational reward (one that you instantly get after you've reached wherever you are travelling to). You can, in some cases not all, feel accomplished because you are experiencing and feeling something completely different, to what you are used to. We all share a strange reward-feeling whenever we move somewhere, probably because of our nomadic past some trillion-million years ago or something (I'm smart). "
DWa13rkEUkk,I don't agree with any of this
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is so pessimistic! I travel not to see beauty, but to see myself in a new light. I do not travel to show the world I am able, but to show myself the things, and do things, and live. I travel to meet people, to see life differently. I have not travelled much but I did a thing called Broadreach twice now and both times were absolutely life changing. Vaacationing is not the same as travelling. Travelling is imersing yourself in your surroundings and learning to appreciate what you have when you have it. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video makes some good points, but I personally find the best thing about travel is overcoming the challenges. For me, travel is about developing skills to cope with difficult situations, meeting amazing people, enriching your life with unique memories and experiencing a life beyond your own. Sometimes you miss the bus, lose a wallet, get robbed, get homesick, get lost, catch the wrong train, or break a phone but hey got to love the challenge."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm missing the point in this. Are you trying to say our imagination of the destination is better than it can ever be? Because I love traveling by myself spontaneously and hold no expectations. I just travel, mark spots I'd like to photograph (as a photographer/designer) and relax in and completely enjoy the moment. Reality of those scenes is immeasurably better than the  mental images."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sometimes I feel like the only one who is completely fulfilled living where I am. It seems like people yearn to travel for the same reason that people shop - to get a temporary buzz, to fill a whole in themselves ""if only I was in Hawaii"" is the same as ""if only I had the latest shoes"""
DWa13rkEUkk,Is this how other people perceive travel?
DWa13rkEUkk,"For me, travel is a desire to have a different set of experiences. A different set of spices in my food, different temperatures at this time of the year, and different angles and lengths of daylight, and so on and so forth. I travel because I desire the discordant and the difficult and the mundane (but with a slightly different birdsong in the background)."
DWa13rkEUkk,Uhm no.
DWa13rkEUkk,Utterly true
DWa13rkEUkk,I think this reflects people from London and not necessarily the world. I use to feel like that when there but don't at all now
DWa13rkEUkk,"Some people say that you should travel to open your mind, see the world from a different perspective."
DWa13rkEUkk,That is only really true if you have a closed mind to begin with.
DWa13rkEUkk,"The expenses and airport hassles, packing, leaving my home just doesn't appeal to me anymore. It better be worth it, after all, the beach in L.A. is different than the beach in Athens how? Exactly."
DWa13rkEUkk,"But surely this is only relevant if you are going for the view or the wish to observe other cultures. If you go for experiences then is it not worth it? Watching the waves for 2 mins is dull, swimming in them is not"
DWa13rkEUkk,so true don't bother taking holidays you can't escape yourself
DWa13rkEUkk,"If this were true, everyone would just stop travelling after a couple times."
DWa13rkEUkk,"So if you're depressed and miserable, traveling won't make it better? Well, from personal experience, I disagree"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This may ring true for some people, but my travel experiences ascend me to levels of joy that someone else's picture never could. The pictures I take bring back the memories and emotions I experienced,  and remind me why I keep on traveling,  hiking, etc.  Not everything goes ""just right"" on a vacation,  however those unexpected or undesired moments almost never take away from the overall joy of the trip.  ?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I have never regretted travel,,,even when I went on  my worst trip  to the rundown island SriLanka! It was way better than sitting at home!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"The point is to take a train or whatever to a destination you know nothing about. That's his I do it, and it never disappoints me ;) MORE ADVENTURE, LESS PLANNING!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This channel is brilliant, but hilariously pessimistic sometimes."
DWa13rkEUkk,They could have at least mentioned the fact that our same flaw gives us a 3-second romanticised glimpse of a place for the rest of our lives.
DWa13rkEUkk,I wonder if they're erring on the side of controversial to stir up the conversation.
DWa13rkEUkk,"lao tzu said 'a good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving'. I live my life traveling and there is no destination, I prefer poor countries where i stay in buddhist temples or slums and learn from it."
DWa13rkEUkk,"It looks like this channel has a problem with everything ,.......  and there is a big difference between Tourists and Travelers  ... i think this video describes best the Tourist sheep crowd ....."
DWa13rkEUkk,"That's just depressing. People dont travel for the view. People travel to have experiences, know places and understand their place in the world, you can eat the local food, feel the wind in your hair and smell exotic flavors. And by the way, If you dont want to carry yourself to New places why you Think you will be happier at home?"
DWa13rkEUkk,"hmmm... a difficult but very valid point to make. contrary to what many other users have said, i don't think that the point of the video was to diminish the joy that traveling brings us in any way, but rather to talk about the more annoying, difficult, lackluster parts of it. i clearly remember the enthusiasm peak and dip i felt upon seeing the Eiffel Tower and Psyche Revived By Cupid's Kiss at the Louvre Museum, but had i not had something else to go to afterwards... i would've been quite bored. in that sense, i agree that we 'zoom in' on our dream travels. we romanticize the slice we dreamed of, sometimes without realizing what it comes with. i think it's critical to practice leaving 'ourselves' at the departures gate of airports when we embark on 'sightseeing' travels like this, too. we don't realize we brought ourselves along until we think of how little we got to enjoy and discover, i think. learned something new + will be trying something new. thanks for the perspective TSOL!"
DWa13rkEUkk,fully agree
DWa13rkEUkk,Why do you hate yourself?
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think that the necessity for traveling for many of us is the fact that we want to feel that our life is worthy and we are not wasting anytime , so we prefer to throw hundreds maybe thousand of feeling to get rid of that feeling . And personally that what makes me wanna travel ."
DWa13rkEUkk,That shot wasn't Goa... there's no cows on the beach.
DWa13rkEUkk,Paris is so culturally enriched now yay multiculturalism
DWa13rkEUkk,"I experience all of these factors every time I travel. Yet I save my money and travel every 6 months. I am addicted to travel. The worse part of traveling is post trip depression and guilt. I have spend over $45,000 in 7 years on traveling. I even did some illegal things to sort my traveling addiction. Do I recommend traveling no. It is like getting one tattoo, then you can not stop tattooing yourself causing waste of your beautiful skin and thousands of dollars. I just want to die on one of my trips and my soul will be rest in peace."
DWa13rkEUkk,What is the difference between a traveller and a tourist?
DWa13rkEUkk,Unsubscribing. This is someone who hasnt immersed themselves for more than a weekend in an area or region of the world. Not someone who has felt personal accomplishment by challenging themselves as they travel through the entire world.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't feel this way at all! Seeing in person is way better. Breathe in the air, relax, leave who you are at home. Anxieties may still linger but I feel at peace in a place where no one knows my name."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Maybe there's something deeply wrong with you guys. Waves breaking over a rock is calming, I suspect for most people, rather than making people antsy. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"I like seeing the different lives, ways of doing things, sounds and smells, even things people might normally censor out of their albums. When I travel, especially when traveling alone, I become a slightly different person, and leave some of myself back home."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Have you ever met someone who was sad, depressed or cranky before they went on holiday? Did that person come back the same? No. They did not. There is a mental relief of going on holiday that brings you back fresh and ready to take your life on. In this video you took the wrong angle."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is.... dare I say it...complete rubbish. I suppose Mr de Botton hates travelling, or the feeling he has while travelling. The rest of us enjoy travel and don't spend a fortune seeing the world."
DWa13rkEUkk,I'm not really a fan of travelling but I went to Paris a couple of weeks ago and it wasn't nearly as depressing as the video makes out. I hope the narrator is seeing a therapist.
DWa13rkEUkk,I also never daydream about going to distant lands. I only went to Paris because a friend invited me and my mum said it would be nice for me to go somewhere this summer. Is that what it's like for people who want to travel?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Sitting in a hotel in Kyoto Japan while on a trip through Asia, this video is really unfair to the experience that traveling is. It's not mental snapshots it's culture, history, food, experiences, and memory making. Yeah, if you only went to a place to take a picture of yourself in front of something you'll be disappointed, but only because you're not diving deep enough, not because it's a waste of time. I think it's so important for people to travel and get perspective on the world they live in. Spend your money on experiences not things. Buying every iteration of the iPhone is disappointing and a waste of money, traveling is definitely not."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Normally I agree with your videos, but this one I don't. You are stating that the holiday that you dream of is condensed down to single images that can be tainted by the un-thought of process to go to those locations. However I see it differently, when going on a holiday the un-thought of trials end up enhancing the experience of the holiday, and using emotional intelligence you can see the beauty in the journey and not just fixate on things that don't go according to plan. In addition to this, there is the unknown surprises like talking to a friendly local, discovering a picturesque location or just experiencing something unique like a sun set over the ocean for the first time when you have lived on the east coast your entire life. So the holidays aren't satisfied by the instant gratification of looking at a picture and thinking how wonderful it would be to be there (and only to be disapointed later), they are great and satisfying because of the journey and the unknown."
DWa13rkEUkk,I absorb beauty slowly.
DWa13rkEUkk,"There is no need to have unrealistic expectations. This video seems to be for someone that hadn't ever traveled anywhere and is highly disappointed with their very first experience. I've gone to Colombia, Venezuela, Brasil, Argentina and Uruguay, seeking for exactly what I got: the splendour of nature and cool summer breezes ? The excitement of knowing exotic animals in their natural habitats ???? The interesting chance too meet such nice and warm people! The crafts, the culture, the idiomatic expressions, and omg the food! I genuinely love travelling, and I can tell for sure: it is SO much better than just looking at pictures at instagram or magazines. If you can't appreciate all that when you travel, the problem isn't the place you go, it's you and your high expectations, you and your problems to enjoy experiences, to enjoy life itself!"
DWa13rkEUkk,Travel is about meeting people and being out of your comfort zone. If youre travelling for a view youre doing it wrong. A vacation is different.
DWa13rkEUkk,Yes I know what this guy is talking about! When I went to Mexico and the Dominican I remember carrying a lot of mental baggage in the form of regret. I did enjoy my trips but I felt I couldn't enjoy it fully because of the events that happened in my life. You must find happiness within first and then go travelling. Nothing in the outside world will give you true happiness. You only achieve a higher vibration if you look within and begin to like yourself!  Crazy good video!!!
DWa13rkEUkk,"If that's what you think travel is about, you really should get out more."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I would recommend Europe. There you can see countless mosques, economic refugees, garbage in the streets, and attractive women wearing burkas. Western Civ at its finest."
DWa13rkEUkk,"oh, I thought you'd talk about something completely different. Like the issue that comes when you've been away for so long that you ungrounded, you dread the next flight and the process of this whole thing. (maybe it's just an ""international student"" kinda problem only). I do not sit and dream about going away but when I am away I am there with myself and I fully know that. Point to make from the rest of the comments - you are the ""School of Life"" and your viewers are in a way your students, keep in mind that although there would be new viewers every day, many of us have so to say ""advanced"" in our studies, maybe we can get some advanced lessons?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Completely disagree but everyone is entitled to their own opinion (y)
DWa13rkEUkk,Just came back from 3 weeks in Europe and Caucasia. Absolutely amazing experience. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world despite being on the toilet for half the time. This video couldn't be further from the truth.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I decided to go to the coast to swim in the ocean in the sunshine. But it rained the whole time. I tried to swim but the waves were literally pulling me down the shore a few feet from shore and I about drowned from struggling to get back. I was wet all the time from rain. There were huge mushrooms growing by parking lots. The sky was grey. And I planned to camp out. But forgot the tent, so slept in the car. I decided to walk thru a woods near town. I saw a fox that came very close and was not afraid. I decided to keep walking but the paths curved under the trees and it got dark and my light went dead. I thought I was walking back but actually was walking away and ended up miles away when I broke out of the woods into the yard of a drunk woman with new age stuff in her yard. I talked with her but she had called the police, who came and took me back to the other county hardly believing my story, until we got back and there was police waiting there because you were not allowed in the woods after dark. They couldn't believe someone could get so totally lost in what to them was a very tame park. Yes, I was pretty tired and miserable going thru it but you liked hearing the story."
DWa13rkEUkk,This is dumb
DWa13rkEUkk,I still want to go to Turks and Caicos
DWa13rkEUkk,Travel is overrated
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't believe the point of this film is to try to discourage us from traveling but rather to shed light on the fact that people often travel with a motive besides the joy of travel. What they are trying to illustrate is often we create a far more romantic idea of a place than what we feel upon actually traveling there which can lead to the issue they talk about towards the end of the film with us ""Bringing ourselves along to every destination"" , this not being our physical selves of course, but all the complicated and negative emotions we experience day to day which we then bring to these places which we before had such an idealized view of. We shouldn't travel chasing a dream of a place we saw on the internet, but rather for the pure raw joy of the journey in which we embark upon. Just my interpretation."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video applies to vacationers, not adventurers....they are not the same."
DWa13rkEUkk,I don't like to travel at all...
DWa13rkEUkk,FITE ME!
DWa13rkEUkk,"There are, notably, about a half dozen other ""School of Life"" videos about [the joys, aims, ways, and art of] ""travel."""
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is probably saltier than those. But many of you are grown ups, and this isn't Sesame Street. You can't expect to be spoon-fed nuances anymore [if you ever were?] Use what you can use. Identify your own problems. Travel doesn't need its honor defended by you. ?"
DWa13rkEUkk,Visit Nepal
DWa13rkEUkk,"I'm glad you brought this up. There's a reason our word 'travel' comes from the Middle French 'travail'. Yeah, it's great. Get strip-searched coming and going twice. Find yourself delayed or stranded by some natural catastrophe or instance of social upheaval. Or clapped into the local gaol over some perceived violation. Nearly everywhere you go anymore, what you experience are the local peculiarities for the implementation of Agenda 21/2030. I live in one of the renowned tourism hotspot destinations, and what I see all the time is a bunch of people knocking themselves out TRYING to have a good time...."
DWa13rkEUkk,the problem is not with travel...it's with our expectations... I feel that everyone should be encouraged to travel because it gives you a different perspective on the world and home simultaneously.  I don't think this video did a good job of explaining the difference.
DWa13rkEUkk,Disagreed .. (Big fan of your channel) 
DWa13rkEUkk,"there no such thing as a bad trip , it's all memory. You can laugh and look back at the bad one later . Plus you take the good with the bad and learn about the world and yourself at the same time. "
DWa13rkEUkk,I want  to show this to everyone  who complains people don't travel enough.
DWa13rkEUkk,"i hate it when people dont realize that you enjoy a week or two traveling and then you have to come back to reality and worse months or even years to pay for such travel, which memory is gonna last longer? the week at Europe or the time after trying to catch up financially , and yes im talking about middle class people, i know rich people dont care"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't know what is the point of this video! You should know that most of the viewers of this channels are not shallow minded or superficial people, we don't travel as a tourist, we travel to see life as it is and we all know that life isn't just all beauty, we know that life is both beauty and the ugly and we strive to experience both so we can develop an unbiased personal view of life."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree this is true if you have high expectations and don't travel much. But I think the more you travel, the more you'll become accustomed to the disappointment or will find better ways to avoid that disappointment the next time you travel. Such as, booking a better flight + room, hiring a tour guide, planning locations to see, renting a car, etc. But the truth is, if you want a perfect vacation---one that will never disappoint you, you need experience & a high budget. It's why people spend $10k+ on luxury trips because the mental image in their heads is what these luxury resorts and packages offer."
DWa13rkEUkk,"“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.”"
DWa13rkEUkk,"...today, with the internet, there is no 'real need' to leave one's home "
DWa13rkEUkk,...Travelogs and Delivery Services can keep you at home 'studying' the Universe 24/7
DWa13rkEUkk,"...PLUS, avoid bulk administration of medicine and jetlag, adaptation to food, and local law anomalies and maps of the best tourist attractions and kidnappings for ransom"
DWa13rkEUkk,As a travel filmmaker ? I found this video very depressing.
DWa13rkEUkk,Almost every negative thing he pointed out in the video are things I enjoy about travel. Idk maybe it's just me. Just because this guy travels so much that it's become boring. Also more so than seeing sights while traveling I want to meet people and make a connection in a different part of the world. I typically like your videos but this is based more in opinion than fact.
DWa13rkEUkk,not really. not everyone is as sad or problematic as you. lol
DWa13rkEUkk,Knock off kurzegesagt
DWa13rkEUkk,"New places, new cultures and food , new people are best remedy against ignorance, bigotry and other maladies affecting our lives.   "
DWa13rkEUkk,"The planes, the waiting , the money are small price to pay for life and adventure"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I highly disagree with this because as a self aware person and while knowing the true reality of those dream destinations, travelling has really changed my life. It WAS awesome, it was dream-like and I loved every single bit of everytime I have travelled. Both the sunset at Venice beach and the uncomfortable plane seats. One of the reasons for that is I've travelled  both with friends/family and by myself so I can tell you if you have these close people with you you really don't care about how mediocre the fucking airplane food was. You claim to be an open-minded organization but what you are doing is changing the facts in order to fit your philosophical agenda and you're changing philosophy into how you should think philosophy is. Unsubscribed."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I so much disagree with what you say... The plane, the taxi and the hotel are integraly part of the journey and I appreciate them in the sake of  adventure, thrill and discovery. Rubbishes on the ground won't make my trip a nightmare."
DWa13rkEUkk,no. just no.
DWa13rkEUkk,"When there is city with vibrant bunch of humans, diversified societies, different cultures, different languages, huge array of mountains, trees, water bodies and you have every corner of the street that can to be romanticised, then travelling to distant places would be loathsome. Commute would be interesting and never boring again. There would be less travellers from that city."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Actually, psychologically speaking, the idea that you take yourself and all your problems with you isn't quite accurate."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Obviously it's you doing the traveling; but from the psychological studies I've read on the subject, traveling has proven to change people's personalities. Things like Openness to Experience, Problem Solving, Emotional Stability, and even our own mental image of ourselves are all affected. These items change your personality, so it can be said that the you at home versus the you while and after traveling are distinct in concrete and important ways."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think this video is trying to point out that traveling is not the best thing in life, as media (specially social media) tries to tell us every day. It's easy to make others frustrated when they can't go somewhere (because of money, responsibilities, etc.) and being reminded how ""life-changing"", ""essential"" and ""awesome"" it is doesn't help."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I cannot travel because I do not have the means. I am more of a spiritual person too. But just like cosmetic industry would lure us into believing, you don't have the perfect skin tone, I was lured too, by all the hype around travelling to believe that my life is not good enough. Now strangely enough, I never felt like this until social media became big in my country, some friends of mine started craving more travel, travel vlogs became common. And I found myself falling for it. I was tricked into thinking I can't be happy untill I have spent enough of my life on some faraway beaches or mountains. Deep inside, I knew, its a lie just like the skin tone advertisement. Now I am sure. I am happy within my means, with what I have, in my little life. Because happiness comes from within. If I ever travel now, I don't want it to be for the reason that everyone else is."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree. went through the same think during my travels. people are always like ""I wanna go to Hawaii my life would be so much better"" but you know what. there are people who are depressed in Hawaii. people who work and live there. its just another place with nicer weather. if you feel like you need to get out of your city and be somewhere else there*s something to deal with at home that you're supressing. you will eventually have to deal with it once you get home or you'll never be happy. don't get me wrong - I love traveling and think its healthy, but don't do it because you're trying to run away from something."
DWa13rkEUkk,"For me, what's wrong with travel is that we get a censored version of what the place we visit actually is. There is simply not enough time to experience what the place we've visited has to offer. My preference is to relax by a pool for a week. After living abroad for many years, I've come to a conclusion that travel is just not worth it. Travel to me seems to be about lying to yourself about how deep and life changing your trip was. It wasn't."
DWa13rkEUkk,This guy sounds like he hates himself.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I hate to say this but each time I travel abroad, it further solidifies my lack of faith in humanity. You can cacoon yourself in a 5-star hotel somewhere, but the truth is that when you meet the locals you realise that this world really is a messed up place! Depressing."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This makes nothing but obvious points like 'we bring our negative aspects of ourself with us wherever we go' and 'travel isn't as glamorous as it looks like in photos'. Do you really think people don't know this already? The point of traveling is to get away from the stressful, mundane, and monotonous, not to entirely escape from ourselves."
DWa13rkEUkk,Its not what you do or where you go but who you do it with................
DWa13rkEUkk,"Ah, the ""snapshot"" of travel. Who else always deconstructs to the opposite, placing your mental image in the reality of that scenic location, and feeling uncomfortable? ""It's too early, I'm jetlagged,  trodding on the wet grass in the dark light of pre-dawn, which sticks to my shoes, and makes me uncomfortable. I over-dressed for this cross-country walk to my Highlands cottage, which has already cost a small fortune. I should have just stayed in my room, pulling the curtains and turning down the AC; it'd have been much cheaper..."""
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think he is paraphrasing an idea by Seneca ""your faults will follow you whithersoever you travel. 2. Socrates made the same remark to one who complained; he said: ""Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you? The reason which set you wandering is ever at your heels."" What pleasure is there in seeing new lands? Or in surveying cities and spots of interest? All your bustle is useless. Do you ask why such flight does not help you? It is because you flee along with yourself. You must lay aside the burdens of the mind; until you do this, no place will satisfy you. 3. Reflect that your present behaviour is like that of the prophetess whom Vergil describes:[3] she is excited and goaded into fury, and contains within herself much inspiration that is not her own:"" It is not that you shouldn't travel, just do it for the right reasons and don't expect it to cure all of your problems."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Why not travel with a reason? Not just go there because you want to see that place, but go there with bussiness, that made me like a travelling experience despite the long, slow train experience and other nasty stuff."
DWa13rkEUkk,"speaking from experience travelling is just not worth it at all, you want to go somewhere and see stuff, you can see much better stuff using the net, you wish you would go to tropical bullshit only to find yourself fighting insects and unable to understand the locals, being theft, etc  and the worst of the worse is the plague of needless selfies! you don't need to show everything about your life to yourself or others! no one will care, no one cared before, and no one will ever care,  your're just lying to yourself,  you want to show off , waste money, waste resources over ignore able  things, even visiting your relatives is a chore in itself, the outside world is not worth it any longer, never was and never will return. you want to change your atmosphere? go have a jog around, walk around the district, go to the nearby park, you don't need to waste too much to get too little. it just is not worth it"
DWa13rkEUkk,I love the school of life channel. But hands down this is the worst video I've seen them make. You don't need to travel because picturing in your head is more rewarding? What a load of crap. Sounds like someone who hasn't been curious/courageous enough to explore our beautiful planet made this while being mad they were stuck in an office.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I understand what you were trying to say during this video but that is why it is important to travel to see friends or family or to take a trip with someone to enjoy time with that person.  It isn't the destination that matters but rather who you will see and spend time with and what you will experience.   Also seeing the bad in the world may give you a more realistic world view and may change your perception to try to make a difference.  For instance, if you see poverty or a trash covered beach it may make you more inclined to donate to the poor or start an initiative to clean beaches.  I know you are trying to say that if you travel to escape your problems you are more than likely to bring them with you and vacation by itself won't fix your problems.  There are times when indeed all we need is a little break from our routine to make us realize that there is something to look forward to.  We should also not try to have unrealistic expectation that the world somewhere else will somehow be better than where we are at."
DWa13rkEUkk,Take a drive across the country. Beauty is not a fleeting moment. It is a breathtaking experience.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think the problem is they didn't specify what type of travelling they were talking about which is most likely traveling to escape, this whole video makes more sense that way because essentially they're people that like to travel for many positive reasons and that have a positive experience, but of course if you're trying to get away from your problems and worries you'll only bring it with you which is what I think this video is about"
DWa13rkEUkk,"who the hell will travel alone (ok, some people even can make friends easily)? we must travel to get out of our routine. And travel will make us to know other societies. other way of thinking, of seeing the world. And to see great landscapes and buildings and different things. I am from Amazon (Brazil), and I came to Europe some years ago just to realize our food is far better. :)"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Terrible video. Kind of done with this channel trying to make some of the best parts of being alive, just a bit shitty. Why even go to the park down the street? There might be something there that I pictured in my mind as beautiful or enjoyable there... but I won't like it soon after seeing that it's not quite what I imagined... wtf? Hey guys, don't bother with any of those adventures you had planned. They won't be what you expected. What a load of dog shit. This actually pissed me off. Travel is nothing but good if you're doing it right."
DWa13rkEUkk,Disagree. I take the complete opposite side of this trade.
DWa13rkEUkk,Travel wakes up a person you barely knew existed by getting you out of your daily routine & putting you into a completely-different environment. 
DWa13rkEUkk,Well this is a bit depressing ngl
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think the point of this video should be that people shouldn't expect to gain happiness and fulfillment through travel, even though they may experience both of these emotions. Travel can be wonderful but by living for travel (or anything for that matter), we fail to be present in our lives and miss out on so much."
DWa13rkEUkk,"The point is that travel is not a form of escapism, like so many of us are led to believe."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video isn't supposed to make you hate travelling, but I think it's trying to articulate the weird sense of disappointment some of us feel when we travel, and the reason why travelling may not be for everyone. If you love to travel and you experience good things while travelling, *that is still valid*. It's just that for those of us who don't experience all those good things, who feel nervous about travelling, or disillusioned or out of place or whatever..those feelings are valid as well."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't think that he's arguing that people shouldn't travel..I think he's arguing that if the main reason for us to travel is to escape from our ordinary lives at home, we'll be bitterly disappointed with reality of the place we dream about."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travel should really be more about learning than anything else. If you have to go 10,000 miles to simulate living a better life for a week, you're regular life sucks and that's what needs a change."
DWa13rkEUkk,But its india...
DWa13rkEUkk,Christ you guys are miserable.
DWa13rkEUkk,"In this time, continuosly we can hear all people say about, The Greatest travel, like a utopia, the great secret of life or the best moment you have ever lived, so, this ""greating"" can will be a trouble, because expectations like to find lot friends, adventures and love, when is only tired, disapoinment, and expensive experience. That will be a reason for sense guilty for many peoples in the future."
DWa13rkEUkk,"So are you saying that these immigrants to Europe make the unavoidable mistake of brining themselves along with them, their culture, traditions etc.?  I expect you're not saying that but it seems entirely true given the reports in the news of their behaviour so that's what I take from your presentation."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Bad title. This all depends on how you view travelling. Only an idiot would go to Paris solely because of the Eiffel tower. If you travel to take in all that the city's got, to see the side of the city that tv doesn't show and to learn and have a good time, then travel is NEVER bad."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Much like everything else.. people can make traveling a drug.  It can be healthy if done with the correct intent, but, also can become escapism, or ego gratification.  Others can try to place it as their purpose in life because it sounds like a good idea, but it is not congruent with what they truly want.   If you are at the point where you need to do it more and more to get the same high, it might be time to self assess."
DWa13rkEUkk,"To everyone hating on the video; read the title. ""The problem with travel"". Why do you expect him to render a positive portrayal of travel when the focus here are the less explored negative aspects of travel. If a video was titled ""the problem with marriage"", wouldn't you expect it to give an account of the issues of marriage. Mature people are expected to appreciate the duality of life, nothing is wholly good or bad. We all know travel is great but there are negatives too."
DWa13rkEUkk,Who is writing this text? I know who narrates is but is it the same person who actually thought all this and wrote it down ?
DWa13rkEUkk,"Whomever wrote this need to get into see a good therapist, pronto.  There are definitely some issues going on that the person needs to deal with and resolve.  Possibly, by actually getting the hell out of their current physical location in order to gain perspective on their life and troubles and thereby have a renewed sense of self and find the confidence to overcome the inner demons."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is what happens to people whom their job includes lots of traveling and most likely they have also the privileged to enjoy lots of vacations and can afford a variety of settings: from luxurious to middle class. It's also the view of someone going into depression or already in depression. It can also be the pessimist view of some one right immature that thought very stupidly that the reality of travel is just like those advertisement photos, like every min of it or even a great deal of it. Who could be so out of touch with reality to think a vacation is just like the photo pictures it??? When you work hard, you love going on vacation and YES traveling, you change environments, change scenery, you see new things, live and create new experiences, eat different food, see different people, maybe even get to know them a little, get to know a little of a culture, buy nice trinkets, eat out and enjoy, because YOU DO want to enjoy it, because you have earned it with hard work, because you do not need to take the stresses back from home to the trip, but if you have great problems and you are in depression no matter how much you change your environment, if you keep putting the root of your depression away, every place in the world is going to be cumbersome, no photo or scenery will be taken with real joy, travel will be a BURDEN just like this video pictures it."
DWa13rkEUkk,"The sad fact of seeing the beaches with trash all over it, or sad little hotel room, is part of journey. This video is only for those that have romanticized the perfect vacation only to be disappointed when reality sets in.  I once paid $100 for a meal that I was looking forward to, only to be disappointed. Do i get down about it? no. My curiosity of a certain dish wouldn't have been sated even if you had simply told me, it's not as great as you think. It's only when I try it, that I truly experience life. Least we all just live vicariously through youtube videos and never actually live a little."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Alain, give it up mate. Your views on travel are rather contrived and annoying. and so was your book and show on travel. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"Terrible. Do not let fears of ""complications"" stop you! I am so grateful for all of my travel experiences and feel enriched for them. Those experiences--the sights, smells, people, exposure--are something that can never be taken away. Of course beautiful places have gritty sides and other things that one might find unpleasant. But that is the nature of the human condition! Nothing is perfect and in those places of imperfection, we find what is real and unique. Embrace it all, and do not get caught up in fantasy. I have never been disappointed. Of course travel is not to run away from your life. But everyone needs--and can benefit from--stepping away for a time to explore the world that exists beyond the tip of your nose."
DWa13rkEUkk,Pure garbage. Very bad to make videos like this just to sell another self help book. I hope this SOL will stop someday.
DWa13rkEUkk,"Agreed.  Travel, at least for me, is not worth it if you go only for the tourist attractions.  Travel is definitely worth it, however, if you immerse yourself in the entirety of the country as a whole, get to know some everyday people - and not just those who work with tourists in some capacity.   For example when I recall being in Petra, Jordan, I do remember the beautiful red cliffs and carved columns - but much more so, I remember the conversations with the local Beduin guys about life in general.  For example they complained how they weren't allowed to have girlfriends ;)"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't know why so many people are being so put off by this video. They are bringing up valid and very true points. Don't get me wrong, travelling a luxury to the soul and mind and almost every time an enriching experience. But it is not the solution to your discontent at work or home or the all out representation of a better life like social media tends to make it out to be."
DWa13rkEUkk,"No. Holidays are holidays. Travel is not a holiday it's an experience in life; a means to gather knowledge, an essential part of the human experience.  Goals are never satisfying to reach bare than the mere seconds of achievement, whereas the experience of achieving is the true lesson.  Immersion in another culture, requiring the sustenance of a long journey is travel in the intrinsic meaning of the word.  Holiday, I suppose means time off work; leaving the US English, vacation, as the subject of your lesson sir.  Leave travel alone, I'm beginning my third year travelling and it has been worth every cerebral teardrop."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travelling is not really about seeing things but rather than experiencing things. It is about having an open mind and go with the flow, connect with people you would never have met otherwise using the universal language of smile!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"I did a round the world trip for a year and it is one of the best experiences I had so far. Yes, I slept in crappy hotels, met crazy taxi drivers, saw poverty, got terribly  sick but guess what? It Was A Part Of The experience itself, a part that  changes your perspective on the world."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Man, I am the worst travel companion.  I hate traveling with me."
DWa13rkEUkk,I will be making traveling videos!
DWa13rkEUkk,"JUST BECAUSE A BRITISH VOICEOVER TELLS YOU TRAVEL IS OVERRATED, IT IS NOT. TRAVEL WHEN YOU CAN, THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE NEGATIVES!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Friends, let's not get the message of this lesson wrong. They are not saying that travelling is pointless. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"In fact Alain de Botton ( the narrator) has a wonderful book called "" The Art of Travel"" and a documentary with the same name, which you can find on youtube. It is full of valuable insights and it is a lot of fun to watch too!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Thats a failed attempt i would say, its not about the postcards or the photographs -- its all about the experience which i guess you can't get it by daydreaming. Ofcourse there will be few hassles but at the end of the day what matters is the experience and the fulfillment after travel and meeting new people around. Once you look back in your life you dont count the brands you possess or the material things -- its all about experiences and the joyful scenarios that flash in your mind."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I understand the point of the video, but I don't think the comparison shots showing the Champ de Mars and then less glamorous parts of Paris really supported your argument. Just because a city, like any other, has streets sometimes poorer and sometimes richer, does it take away from its beautiful parts? (Not mentioning that you chose to show an evacuated refugee camp/area). A city with no life or soul that looks like a Google image wouldn't inspire anything in me. If I wanted to live in a picture perfect world during my holiday week, I'd just stay inside a 5 star hotel the whole time. Traveling isn't simply about beauty, but also about education, reflection, understanding, and discovery. I'm from Paris and I love the city not only because of its monuments, but because of the culture, the history, and the spirit."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is just for the people who care only about the destination. If you can find enjoyment in the journey there, then this video is not applicable to you in the slightest"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is such a pessimistic approach to travel! Anyone who has ever traveled (or ever will) knows that traveling is not a non-stop thrill ride. There are bumps, scrapes, and other inconveniences that plague the traveler in his or her journey. The idea is to make one's own story relevant in the scope of world travel and, through those experiences, learn to connect with others and ensure an open mind in every encounter. I'm disappointed in School o' Life for having presented such a dull view of travel. After all, traveling is the tits."
DWa13rkEUkk,so you say that we should go see a therapist rather than travelling... it doesn't help that ur a therapist urself
DWa13rkEUkk,"they should use the word vacation, not travel.. travelling is not about the places..."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I disagree. A person living in Dallas cannot ever experience the joy of scuba diving and exploring the coral reefs and vast ocean life of the Caribbean, or the wonder of gazing at the northern lights under a glass dome, or the rush of skiing down the rocky mountains without leaving Dallas. Sure the trip may be tedious, the hotel may be mediocre, the city may have many of the same problems as your home city, but those aren't the reasons you travel. You travel to explore other parts of the world and to experience things you wouldn't be able to experience in your own city. Seeing a picture of a coral reef is one thing. Being up close and personal to a sea turtle or a reef shark is a completely different experience. Seeing a video of the norther lights is cool, witnessing it with your own eyes during the long winter night far in the north is an experience you will keep your entire life. You travel to momentarily get away from the mundane boring city you see every day and to experience something new. Remaining in one place your entire life is the equivalent of only ever reading one book or only ever watching one movie or learning one thing. There's so much more to life than just staying put and sticking to the small world you know."
DWa13rkEUkk,have you guys travelled? I'm confused with this..
DWa13rkEUkk,all this video makes me want to do is go travelling...
DWa13rkEUkk,LIES! I have always enjoyed traveling! UNSUBSCRIBING!
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is the problem with travel. Go somewhere half way across the world, learn another language, go see places and try foods you never new existed, meet a friend from another culture. Then look at a photo and tell me that you should've just stayed at home and clicked through a gallery because your trip would never meet your expectations."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I like this video but, as is the case most often, I disagree with it immensely."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Yes, there are parts of travel we edit out in our pictures and memories. But the joy of travelling is much more than the superficial enjoyment of a beautiful vista. When travelling, what we do is experience novelty. We meet novel people, see novel environments and buildings, and dip our toes in novel cultures. Most people crave novelty because new experiences can help us learn about the world and about ourselves. This is why I love to travel!"
DWa13rkEUkk,Don't be a tourist
DWa13rkEUkk,"School of life.... what are you talking about? This video has no meaning, no sense, no point, and it vastly exaggerates travel as something negative and nothing more. Sometimes I watch your videos and when I am done I literally gained no knowledge or don't understand the point or lesson to be learned."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Travel has honestly bought me so much joy. Be in the mountains in Nepal, or lunch at the Pantheon in Rome.  The US Nation Parks, or sunset the Eiffel Tower. Honestly no photos can do these places justice. Ever. "
DWa13rkEUkk,"The only reason this can't be called cheap philosophy is that bouton sells it preety overpriced in the shop. This is not translating philosophy to everyday life, its profiting on the fact that philosophy is suffering from a lack of stability in its premisses and the consequential perception, from those who aproach it from afar, that philosophy does not require to be formaly proven ( even if the proof is not as a formal proof in mathematics or even logic, for that read any of kant' s critique). Moreover, he is stealling the possibility for people genuinely interested in philosophy to actualy learn something philosophical, when they, by random chance, while taking their first steps on the field, are directed to this channel. I would recommend disregarding this channel until learning some philosophy first, and you will be, specialy on the videos regarding famous thinkers, able to see that he only uses their name to justify his ideology and to shove down peoples throats his overpriced anticapitalist notebooks and other items of political consumption. But thats another story for another time"
DWa13rkEUkk,"Unpopular opinion: tourism ruined Spain, the local Spaniards can’t even live in their own cities because they can’t afford to, at least under Franco the average Spaniard could afford to live in cities."
DWa13rkEUkk,"You know what the real problem with travel is? It's the social expectation that you have to travel. Whilst I do believe that travel does broadens the mind, It upsets me that most of the comments are basically 'you have to travel', when for most people travel is a luxury that you sometimes can't afford. Not everybody can travel the world on a whim, or get bank rolled by their parents so they can. And what makes this problem worse is social media. You see pictures in your feed of your friends in exotic places, whilst you're sat at home living paycheck-to-paycheck. And then when you finally get the money to travel and the time to, you end up building this picture in your brain of how amazing you're trip is going to be, only to find it doesn't meet your expectations."
DWa13rkEUkk,"So if i go to the slums of India to make peoples lives better i would be intruding? yea right this video suks its not true, its for idiots"
DWa13rkEUkk,Earlyyyy
DWa13rkEUkk,"I hardly ever travel, haven’t been on holiday in years. I don’t dream of travelling either. I’m happy where I am. I hate long journeys, trains, ships, planes, airports, train stations. Horrible."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Been following SoL for years and feel it has watered down it's content for mouth breathers..What is with the click bait title. To sum up this video in on quote. ""Its not the destination,but the journey""...bring back philosophy or big questions pertaining to A.I or something with more teeth. Still love the channel. -anon"
DWa13rkEUkk,"What a negative attitude! In everything there is a positive and a negative side. The news are sold better when they are painful,  no wonder the newscasters look for tragedies everyday. Are you guys trying to do the same? Get people interest by showing the negative part of traveling? Many statements are right,  but traveling has so much to offer to anybody's life and is one of the most precious way of growing  to be a better person. It may bring magic moments that last a lifetime and the bad ones make you stronger and wiser. Your video is not to be priced for the negative pessimistic view of one of the most rewarding experience any human beings can have in life. It is misleading and it is no fair to the public.  Sorry but this is my opinion."
DWa13rkEUkk,"Hikers are the worst, thats all i know."
DWa13rkEUkk,Lol when he describes how eurotrash goes vacationing
DWa13rkEUkk,You know you have more vacation days than sense when you are generally characterized as choosing vacation destinations on photos and feelings
DWa13rkEUkk,the reason i travel is to experience new cultures. not bc some cheap post card. this is such a negative video
DWa13rkEUkk,"You lost me on this one, TSoL. Traveling is awesome if you can afford to do it. It gives you a chance to get outside of your own ego for a while and see life from a fresh perspective. Just don't expect it to solve all your problems, because you still have to go home eventually."
DWa13rkEUkk,"this is sad and unhelpful. yes, we idealise travel, but the problem isn't that we will be disappointed once we get there, but the classist barriers to it. in my experience, despite the crap parts of travel, you always take away the nice memories and forget the boring bits, making it always worthwhile. but we act like it's a ~rite of passage~ and like you haven't really lived life if you haven't travelled, when only a small percentage of the worlds population can afford to travel and it's a huge privilege to do so. so people will go out of their way to travel and use money they don't have, or they will feel depressed about their lives because their instagram feed isn't full of hammocks and palm trees. that's the problem with travel."
DWa13rkEUkk,hey man did you just assume me
DWa13rkEUkk,What a depressing and pretentious way to look at traveling in this perspective
DWa13rkEUkk,"I don't think the video is being negative, it's just saying to be realistic about travel. Travel is not really ""vacation""; it involves the reality of logistics, physical demand, and emotional expectation. It doesn't necessarily make you smarter or enriched. I've been to four countries in the last year and even moved to Japan, and I find the video's general message to be true, but not pessimistic. We feel accomplished in going through the act of travel, but we really end up looking for the same things to survive to see something for a short time. Good feelings and memories of a place comes more from the people you're with or who you meet, not the 'place' in of itself. I like travel as much as anybody, but this is the reality."
DWa13rkEUkk,Disagree
DWa13rkEUkk,How the hell this is trending
DWa13rkEUkk,"Now that you've covered the curmudgeon's attitude to travel, let's see another video titled, ""The Benefit of Travel."" Both perspectives need to be taken into account."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is a poor take on travel. Firstly it assumes that its superficial aesthetics that motivate travel, but I'd argue it's curiosity about what lies beneath the aesthetics that forces us beyond our daydreams and onto the airplane. It's about uncovering what lies inside the picturesque palace, exploring the taste of the cafe's food, hearing the rush of the city and feeling it's vibrant, electric atmosphere brush against your skin. Although we do bring our personal baggage with us, travel shifts your perspective on the world - travel is the perfect place to lose your baggage (if the airline doesn't do it first). Visiting breathtaking scenery taught me the power and beauty of the world, having someone attempt to bundle me into a bogus taxi 3 hours later taught me to set aside my anxieties and stand firm. I think most people who've travelled will agree that both experiences are as valid and important as each other."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I think a lot of people are missing the point. The video is not saying that travel is shit and has no upsides. People are already well aware of the positives of travelling. It's simply saying that travel can also be fraught with complications and hardships that are omitted in overly simplistic tourism industry advertising and social media posts. There's a reason that the word 'travel' is derived from the French 'travail,'  originally meaning 'to labour, toil, trouble.' I just travelled around South East Asia and had the shits almost the whole time, (which I did not find to be character-building) and although I found visiting these places enriching I was also glad to come home."
DWa13rkEUkk,You ok School of Life? Did you have a bad experience in Paris or something?
DWa13rkEUkk,Possibly the only SOL video I've disagreed with in its entirety!
DWa13rkEUkk,Im early wow
DWa13rkEUkk,"Out of all the videos I watched from School of Life, this is one that I don't personally like. Sure, it all maybe true.. there are frustrations that comes with travel. I recently went to Iceland and we had long layover and on our first day we had an accident with our camper van that cost us a lot of money.. but when I was bathing in a hot spring at night, I saw the northern lights for the very first time and I forgot all those frustrations.. I thought it was all worth it for that moment and I felt really blessed to have experience an incredible thing. "
DWa13rkEUkk,I hate selfies.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video forgets one missing element: the people you meet while traveling. The heart of a culture. The interaction of different lives shared for perhaps a brief moment, or a beginning of a lifelong friendship. I've travelled the world and have met the most beautiful people more extraordinary than any monument seen on a postcard."
DWa13rkEUkk,why you liek dis?
DWa13rkEUkk,"What's with all the self-loathing today, School of life? What makes a travel special IS that we bring ourselves to it. It's our version of the destination that makes the experience special."
DWa13rkEUkk,I like the school of life but I couldn't disagree more with this video. The reason I travel is to see culture and the things that are right and wrong  with a place.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is interesting but the only way this can be true is if you assume that this person traveling is living through their mind. Anxiety, depression, regret , these are all things that can take over,  only if you allow them to. If you are traveling across the world and you cannot step back from out of your mind and be present to enjoy the only thing real, which is the now, then you have a much larger problem that you need to learn to deal with."
DWa13rkEUkk,The problem with traveling is that some people seek adventure and end up dead. It sounds bad and cruel but is true.
DWa13rkEUkk,well that was depressing and i disagree
DWa13rkEUkk,Ey im early as fuuuuu
DWa13rkEUkk,"The old travel habits of the 50s are such a depressing way to look at things. Getting a dinky hotel and staying in one city is no way to explore the world if anything I would recommend visiting hostels they are cheap you meet cool people and you are never in one place of long. I live in one of the most boring places in the world all there is to do is hike and fish, most of the locals are religous fanatics, and if you want to do anything ""fun"" it is going to cost you upwards of 50 dollars. Now a day when you travel we think we need to stay in some expensive hotel and buy expensive tickets to expensive events but if you are not content being you in nature you have no business traveling."
DWa13rkEUkk,Maybe you just have to start being gratefull. I don't understand why people think it is stressfull to fly with a plane or drive with the car to your destination. And planning isn't also so stressfull except the paper work.
DWa13rkEUkk,"I agree on the moments that you have when you expected some place/food/etc. to be great but then it isn't, but things like these also happen to you if you just stay in your hometown."
DWa13rkEUkk,Speak for yourself. What a depressing video.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This must have been the stupidest video I've seen. Unless you have serious depression and self-esteem issues, who gets bummed out that they're on vacation? Everyone has baggage, but the point of vacationing is to enjoy were you're at and not your problems back home."
DWa13rkEUkk,Honestly this guy is complaining about bs
DWa13rkEUkk,"Yes! I agree completely! Please, everyone: listen to Alain and stay put at home. Don't ever travel! That would make it just so much more enjoyable for ME to travel. :-) The worst thing about traveling are the f**ing tourists -- just too many of them!"
DWa13rkEUkk,"This guy's voice is boring. Sorry, this is my opinion."
DWa13rkEUkk,I've got to disagree with the point that bringing your baggage can defeat the purpose of a holiday. This bugger clearly doesn't live in Scotland where we get one beach worthy day a year and you'll be lucky to know when it'll be. Five-sixteen days of beach weather is heaven to us. Sure I know what it feels like but you can only put yourself there mentally for a minute before really comes calling. To be able to stand still outside in fresh air without wearing a fleece and not freeze is a luxury to me. Sure living in a hot country can be stifling but living in cold causes sensory pain and mild distress near constantly.
DWa13rkEUkk,"It isn't simply about what you see, it is also about what you do. I danced with belly dancers in Istanbul, sailed in a gondola in Venice, had gelato in Rome and pizza in Sienna, explored caves in Croatia, took a boat in a magical lake in Slovenia, rode a bike around a magnificent park in Bucharest, visited Count Dracula's castle in Transylvania, had cannoli and walked through ancient ruins in Sicily, hiked on a volcano and watched the sunset on a fortress on the edge of a cliff in Santorini, climbed endless stairs to the top of the Arc de Triomphe and had crepes in the shade of the Notre Dame, had a cruise in the Seine and teared up at the sight of the Victory of Samothrace in the Louvre, visited the castles of the Loire Valley, watched the tide rise up in Mont Saint Michel, sunbathed in Saint Malo and walked along the colorful dollhouses in Honfleur... If you think that my experiences haven't shaped me as a person, haven't widened my mental horizon, then you've probably never felt what it means to travel."
DWa13rkEUkk,I don't agree with what he says but I have a question how can I travel the world and save money ?? How about this idea for a video instead of wasting our time with this crap
DWa13rkEUkk,Terrible opinions only by terrible channels
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is so wrong. Travelling is a free shot at overcoming the anxieties that usually beat us down at home. It's a chance to be the happier, more adventurous version of ourselves that we dream of becoming. The new people we meet and the exotic locations we discover are opportunities to put these improved visions of ourselves into practice. We can do this with the implicit safety net of knowing that even if we completely fail, we can just go home to our regular lives, like waking up from a dream. My experience of travelling is that after returning home I retain some of the habits I developed from those positive experiences and my every day worries seem considerably more trivial."
DWa13rkEUkk,"I dislike this video. I am a person who traveled all over the globe and I did it when I was young. This video is for people who are stuck in dead ends, feel they have no change left. The people who wish they dreamt. Open your self, every day is a holiday. It's a holiday if you don't need to hide for your life or nearly starve to death. Be greatful"
DWa13rkEUkk,Wow way to depress your audience. Travel is only as boring as the person doing it and knowing how to make financial limitations not a major factor. So based on this video I'd guess you are just bad at traveling for fun.
DWa13rkEUkk,"This is not real psychology or science or philosophy for that matter, this is possibly one person's huge misguided philosophy of life, which dehumanizes and  places blame on the individual for the worlds woes, which is opposite of inspiring people to be the change in their lives and therefore the world.  Look to real leaders and real philosophies, if you are interested in your community or the world,   travel see the world,  you wont know what it looks like till you go there,  love yourself, family and friends, dont let websites like this influence your thoughts.   Peace."
DWa13rkEUkk,"This video is so horrible! Of course if you travel for shallow reasons and you already have a negative outlook on life (as the creator of this video seems to have), then you're gonna have a bad time. But if you travel for the sake of experiencing other cultures and expanding your world view, then you will be completely satisfied with far-away journey. Lines at the airport, or cramped hotel rooms don't matter in the long run. "

What struck us most about our Cuban journey was the incredible depth and diversity of Cuba’s history, people, and landscapes. It seemed every bend offered up a new surprise, a new story, a new adventure, each one backed up by some of the world’s most infectious rhythms and smiles."

N4ZMYokojGw,The 50s cars are beautifulllllll ?????
N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba
N4ZMYokojGw,Cubans brothers respect.
N4ZMYokojGw,It's so nice and colonial but it's also sadly quite South American in terms of the slums and urban decay etc.
N4ZMYokojGw,"Awesome Video. I don't understand why you still haven't made a video on Goa, India. It will surely be appreciated. Or Bangalore or Mumbai. I have been watching your videos for so long, it hurts that there is no Indian city. No Hate, but please make a effort to make one."
N4ZMYokojGw,Idk but since my fam and i visited Florida my sis is so obssessed with Cuba probaly beacuse over there its fulled with Cubans!
N4ZMYokojGw,Bulls hit narration...

N4ZMYokojGw,"O vua vua , ovu djanana , O vua vua"
N4ZMYokojGw,Who can say name of song?
N4ZMYokojGw,There's a lot of political corruption
N4ZMYokojGw,why always with background music. Cant understand the speaker
N4ZMYokojGw,Does anyone know the name of the song that's playing in this video?
N4ZMYokojGw,I
N4ZMYokojGw,"Uhh....they neglect to inform you that your travel will be quite restricted as to where you can go and what you can see.  They give various reasons for restrictions but one they don't seem to mention is that the restrictions prevent you from seeing most of the poverty areas.  This return of Cuba to a deprived tourist spot has not come far from the Batista days, has it?  The people selling you the tours might be just a BIT biased.... "
N4ZMYokojGw,dammn seems too touristy filled wit obese americans
N4ZMYokojGw,"Full turism, and living with somethings dollars."
N4ZMYokojGw,"Unique. People, sun and culture"
N4ZMYokojGw,Would have gone only for the cars

N4ZMYokojGw,WOW....very nice see the place....awesome.... Havana...
N4ZMYokojGw,"Forget about Cuba, what camera is this?"
N4ZMYokojGw,Beautiful country and the only country that everyone is equal.
N4ZMYokojGw,Hope nobody take it wrong way! Is it safe to travel ?
N4ZMYokojGw,awesome communist utopia
N4ZMYokojGw,"My mother's cousins went there ( Danielle, rosette) they did not like it.. said everything was old . Oh well"
N4ZMYokojGw,Que bonito cuba
N4ZMYokojGw,Wow here is the “real” Cuba because this isn’t it.
N4ZMYokojGw,"I don't think there's any place, besides Africa / Zanzibar, that I want to visit more than Cuba!"
N4ZMYokojGw,Who else is going to Cuba despite trumps dumb policy?
N4ZMYokojGw,Fiquem a vontade para ir petistas e de preferência não voltem.
N4ZMYokojGw,beautiful communist country
N4ZMYokojGw,Same architecture all over the world.. tartarian
N4ZMYokojGw,Who is here after watching makhna by yo-yo Singh
N4ZMYokojGw,Isn't it really hard to vacation in Cuba if your american?
N4ZMYokojGw,Pure robbery for tourist money
N4ZMYokojGw,Castro made me  come to exile and i still  am here Not a clue what Cuba is now i am lost
N4ZMYokojGw,"Havana (and Cuba) is everything a tourist can expect from a country with lots of history, a brilliant past, culture, arts, music and great times.  Very safe is you are careful, probably the safest country in this hemisphere.  As any other poor nation the lower levels of society are very poor and the country itself is way behind modernization.  The emerging middle class due to small business and tourism as well as the higher levels of government (and their families) can enjoy a life of luxury inside and abroad unknown and inaccessible to most Cubans, but the country in general has a lot to offer:  there is poverty but there are more homeless people in Miami and New York.  Great drinks, great natural landscapes, very friendly people (but sometimes abusive to foreigners) and lots of things to do and enjoy as a visitor.  The airport is a total mess and the flag airline in full bankruptcy.  The only one thing not worthy to mention is the ruling military dictatorship that dreams to hold power forever based on constant lies and full control."
N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba is such a unique and beautiful country. I am still waiting for Expedia to do a Santo Domingo or a Dominican Republic video. 
N4ZMYokojGw,Dominican Republic is the only country in the Caribbean to receive more than five million tourist alone. The Dominican Republic is the number one tourist destination in the Caribbean. The DR also gets more tourist compared to other Latin Countries like Brazil. So why is there no video? That's absurd. 
N4ZMYokojGw,https://youtu.be/Mgbl5Bq3-QY
N4ZMYokojGw,"Every countries have good/bad places & peoples... it depends on the travelers experience. So please Expedia, make a video of my country Nepal ?? having lots of pristine   Places ,adventures hills n mountains ... with amazing more then 100 cultures n tradition. "
N4ZMYokojGw,Yes don’t forget Mt Everest 8848mtr ...
N4ZMYokojGw,"Of course Cube is not in Favourite list, because their enemies are the mighty S"
N4ZMYokojGw,There must be a reason why the talented Cubans left ... could it be ... the CASTROS?!
N4ZMYokojGw,"Song name song name song name????????,"
N4ZMYokojGw,"tbh i just want to see the cars, im big into old cars from my childhood in the 50's and this would bring me back a little bit"
N4ZMYokojGw,it looks like old Mogadishu before the civil war.
N4ZMYokojGw,"welcome to Cuba, American imperialist pigs!"
N4ZMYokojGw,patria o muerte
N4ZMYokojGw,"Really great place to visit, people are very friendly, such a shame the island is so poor and undeveloped."
N4ZMYokojGw,The reality is much much different than is pictured in this video. Poor Cuban people are trying to escape. Communism is evil! ?? and no I have no desire of visiting Dubai either!
N4ZMYokojGw,Iran guide pleaaaaase!!!!
N4ZMYokojGw,Communism ruined this beautiful country so bad... ? ??
N4ZMYokojGw,If you wanna encourage the tourism in Cuba in December you might wanna try celebrate more Christmas to spend their money on theirWarm beaches?
N4ZMYokojGw,"Cuba - paradise water beaches , salsa music , tobacco , old buildings , colourful , history , old timers , nice destination tam bien  ???."
N4ZMYokojGw,Visit if you want to be depressed
N4ZMYokojGw,"I want take a flight go to Visit place, It's not a part of America. That look interesting like Brazil..."
N4ZMYokojGw,"The only reason that Americans are craving to go to Cuba is becoz of it's socialist Government that has made it Unique ,Secure and a good country compared to the other Westernised Caribbean countries. Cubans must do whatever it takes to maintain this Uniqueness."
N4ZMYokojGw,sure i would go if no communist there
N4ZMYokojGw,cuban women are lovely
N4ZMYokojGw,There is nothing exciting in Cuba? Why people are going mad to visit?
N4ZMYokojGw,"Been to Cuba once, saw Veradero and Havana... tbh I'd say it's very over-rated. The city of Havana looks very intriguing, old buildings and cars everywhere, but there really isn't anything that interesting to do there. If you are white then you can't go anywhere without someone trying to sell you something or beg for money in some different way. I hate to say it but Cubans are really unbearable to deal with for more than a week. They have no sense of shame when it comes to ripping you off or guilting you into handing over every cent you have. If you're thinking of going there because it's 'cheap', think again. They have a 'tourist peso' which is equal to the American dollar, independent of their own shitty economy. A fucking red bull in Cuba costs like $5. As for the resorts, they don't have usable wifi, the food is really bad, you have to pay extra for pretty much everything... Cuba is only good if you only plan on staying at the beach all day and drinking. Otherwise, it's really not worthwhile, I'd recommend Mexico or Brazil instead."
N4ZMYokojGw,Is it easier for Americans to travel over there?
N4ZMYokojGw,Does anyone know the name of the cave looking area where people are swimming in the beginning of the video??
N4ZMYokojGw,pudiera estar mucho mejor sin dittatura libre
N4ZMYokojGw,"The island of cuba is a real natural paradise , its a beautiful land .but the government has managed to destroy it themselves."
N4ZMYokojGw,awful nonsense!
N4ZMYokojGw,"Hello Expedia here is a list of places you should have video travel guides for,"
N4ZMYokojGw,"Baltimore, Maryland"
N4ZMYokojGw,"Annapolis, Maryland "
N4ZMYokojGw,"Ocean City, Maryland"
N4ZMYokojGw,Honey singh ..new song ..who is there for it..
N4ZMYokojGw,man Cuba is beautiful just wish it wasn't communist
N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba is one of the most astounding countries I’ve ever been to. Beautiful people & country.
N4ZMYokojGw,Love from Canada
N4ZMYokojGw,"personally, it was a horrible experience."
N4ZMYokojGw,so many thieves and fraud on the street to steal tourist's money there and police don't care about it. 
N4ZMYokojGw,almost same as india
N4ZMYokojGw,"A world of beautiful nature, culture, scientific innovation, and religion is being destroyed by hate and greed of the few. The people should reject their destructive evil mindset and uphold their good life enriching mindset for self-preservation."
N4ZMYokojGw,"I am Irish and have been very lucky to have traveled all over the world including all of Europe, China, Russia, South Africa, United States, the Middle East, Malaysia and many other counties. I have never been to a place like Cuba. The country is fantastic and the people are the most incredible and friendliest people I have ever met. They say us Irish are friendly, but to me the Cuban people take top spot. Long live Cuba. My heart is still there."
N4ZMYokojGw,"Beautiful, but a totalitarian dictatorship with people suffered and slave of the dictator."
N4ZMYokojGw,"CUBA HAVANA ITS A FULL OF WORLD HERITAGES CITY, I BELIEVE IT TOO SHOULD IT BE FAR RICH IN WORLD HERITAGES RATHER THAN ECUADOR, IS IT HAVANA ALSO DECLARED AS WORLD HERITAGES CITY BY UNESCO??  "
N4ZMYokojGw,GOOD LUCK FROM BANGLADESH.
N4ZMYokojGw,fake cuba
N4ZMYokojGw,"The truth about Che Guevara now has its boots on. He helped free Cubans from the repressive Batista regime, only to enslave them in a totalitarian police state that was worse than the previous one he helped to overthrow. He was Fidel Castro's chief executioner, a mass murderer who in 1960 started Cuba's first corrective work camp, better known as a gulag in Russian lingo."
N4ZMYokojGw,My mate went there last year and the only thing he said about it was that nobody seemed to be doing any work.
N4ZMYokojGw,I wonder if Trump will try to block this video from Americans?
N4ZMYokojGw,"jajjaajajja espero que nuestra REPUBLICA Dominicana no sea asi nunca , aca no se pase hambre como en Haiti , Venezuela , Cuba , Africa,  pero arriba animo cubanitos y venezolanitos ustedes no pertenecen a ese mundo , dejenselo para los satanicos de los africanos y haitianos ,  besos de un Dominicano lindo"
N4ZMYokojGw,isn't the narator Fernando Martinez from GTA 3 :)
N4ZMYokojGw,"Which one is better with  teens, Cuba or Dominican Republic?"
N4ZMYokojGw,"Beautiful country, horrible government"
N4ZMYokojGw,"La Habana (y toda Cuba) es todo lo que un turista puede esperar de un pais con mucha historia, un pasado brillante, cultura, arte, musica y grandes momentos.  El pais es seguro si sabes a donde vas, tal vez el mas seguro en este hemisferio.  Como cualquier otro lugar pobre los bajos niveles de la sociedad estan economicamente desesperados y el pais esta muy lejos de la modernizacion.  La clase media emergente del turismo y el negocio medio, asi como las altas esferas del gobierno (y sus familias) pueden disfrutar de una vida de lujos y placer desconocido e inaccessible para el resto de los cubanos, pero el pais en general tiene mucho que ofrecer.  Hay pobreza, pero existen mas desamparados en Miami y Nueva York.  Buenas bebidas, grandes paisajes naturales, gente muy amigable ( a veces explotan al turista), y muchas cosas que hacer y disfrutar.  El aeropuerto es un total desastre y la linea aerea nacional esta en complete bancarrota.  Lo unico no digno de mencionar es la junta militar que gobierna el pais y que piensa seguir asi en el poder basados en puras mentiras y control completo de la nacion."
N4ZMYokojGw,"The voice was told to put on a spanish sounding accent relatable to the gringos, therefore he put on a hollywood mexican accent"
N4ZMYokojGw,I'd go but my Spanish sucks
N4ZMYokojGw,"Fidel Castro is now in the Spirit World Dimension and like Nelson Mandela will be rebreed for his contribution to society and eventually reincarnating as an Unborn Baby with a new set of emotions, which will determine the part he plays in the theatre of life; socially minded or otherwise."
N4ZMYokojGw,Belgium country the best and germani cuba is .............. but not bad
N4ZMYokojGw,But Commuism!
N4ZMYokojGw,"Expedia... This video is really bad, cheesy & completely off base... I would expect better from Expedia... so off fake..."
N4ZMYokojGw,"I know I should probably turn to trip adviser, but what are the dos n don't s in Cuba n if there are anything I should stay out of? Safe to travel alone there as a girl? Please advise"
N4ZMYokojGw,Please do Riyadh
N4ZMYokojGw,"Havana oh nana, half omaha is in havana oh nana..."
N4ZMYokojGw,QUE MISERIA Y QUE ATRASO .... CUBA PUDO SER EL SINGAPUR DEL CARIBE .. PERO LLEGARON  LOS ASESINOS CASTRO Y EL PAÍS SUMIDO EN LAS MAS GRANDE POBREZA... ESA ES LA OBRA DEL SOCIALISMO .. EXTIENDEN LA POBREZA A TODOS ... LA HABANA BELLA CIUDAD  QUE SE QUEDO EN EL PASADO
N4ZMYokojGw,The people there own nothing - the government owns 51% of everything - if a tourist left a guitar there for someone - the police will take it for example - same as a laptop - smart phone - anything of value - the police take it. If you take a local lady for a ride on a scooter just for fun and the police see her she gets charged with prostitution and the cost is about 2 months income for her even though she was just going for a nonsexual ride.
N4ZMYokojGw,"I'm so glad the Socialist government is restoring the country for tourism. I would love to go back to my hometown and see all of this again.  But sadly, all is not as beautiful as this video shows.  Please understand this is an advertisement which doesn't show you the ugly side of Socialism."
N4ZMYokojGw,Cynical feel-good fauxcumentary --- Cuba is North Korea with palm trees.  And the colors have obviously been over-saturated on purpose.
N4ZMYokojGw,the voice is too irritating....
N4ZMYokojGw,"I don’t care if I’m American and it’s Cub we’re talking about. Cuba is a breathtaking place with amazing cuisine, sights, people and nature. I have several friends from Cuba, and both they and their families were some of the most open and nicest people of all. I’m a traveler and Cuba has been on my bucket list for some time now, but I hope I’ll have some time to spare within the year so I can visit this paradise."
N4ZMYokojGw,"One advise for Americans going to Cuba.  Bring Canadian dollars; they get a better exchange rate.  Also, while in Havana, visit Floridita bar and restaurant at the end of Obispo Street.  That was a hangout for Ernest Hemingway (one of many in Cuba).  There's a bronze statue of Hemingway sitting at the end of the bar where many have their pictures taken.  Also, the daiquiri was invented there."
N4ZMYokojGw,this is propaganda; it's a mess.
N4ZMYokojGw,CUBA  IS  VELA  IS  LAY  PUERTO  RICO  BONITO  IS  CARIBE  ????????????????????????????????????   LOVE  CUBA  LOVE  PUERTO  RICO
N4ZMYokojGw,"It's hard to believe looking at the scenes in this video, that there is extreme misery among 95% of the Cuban people from the need to a good food supply and the need of descent good paying jobs, to descent housing to good healthcare.  Yes I've heard the wonders of the health system but that is just well orchestrated propaganda by the Cuban government, few people know that before Castro Cuba was at the top of the heap with good doctors, pharmaceuticals and good modern hospitals available to all of the people. If you could pay you had the private ones and if you couldn't you had public ones paid for by a special tax paid for by everyone who held a Paying job in Cuba."
N4ZMYokojGw,"Shame a beautiful video is scattered with communist propaganda and half trues and lies.. and he can not even pronounce Guevara the right way , by that point the video is already a Propaganda tool for the Communist Regime"
N4ZMYokojGw,But don't forget their still communist
N4ZMYokojGw,"This is literally all for the tourists, this isn't the real Cuba. It's DISGUSTING to see Castro and Che Guevara shown in a positive light after all the blood on their hands. Locals don't even get to see any of this. Gross."
N4ZMYokojGw,Santa Clara is the most anticommunist city of CUBA that is the same to say is the most anti concentration camp. CUBA  is a country where every one person is craving for freedom and desired to escape one day
N4ZMYokojGw,Cuba is a very poor country......................They don't have any modern thing in their country.................They are still living in the 20th century with the vintage cars what they had bought from the USA...................I can't blame them..................Communism is solely responsible for the Cuban destruction.............................. I am so sad to see their poverty and destruction..................
N4ZMYokojGw,Of course they don't speak of politics but it is because of politics and in this case socialist and communist ideas that has kept Cuba 60 years behind every other country. Before Castro  when a new idea or invention  developed anywhere in the world Cuba was among the first countries to adopt  it and in many cases  improve on it.
N4ZMYokojGw,This message brought to you by communist propagandist.

Walking along sea point watching the waves crash against the pier, having a beer at the V&A Waterfront, hiking Table Mountain, watching the sunset at Lions Head, breathing in the fresh Atlantic air at Cape Point... I found it very difficult to leave this place. I was tempted to cancel the rest of my travels and just stay here. Not once did I feel unsafe. In fact, I found the people to be incredibly friendly. A smile goes a long way. I will 100% be back to this beautiful city again."

KnLsngMT5Eg,"Gibraltar is British (not English, as this video keeps saying). The Spanish ceded their claim in an international treaty. I can’t understand why they think otherwise. And even if they do, what about their own territories of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa, entirely surrounded by Morocco? Double standards?"
KnLsngMT5Eg,"A nice video, but it's not a small part of England, it's a small part of BRITAIN (or United Kingdom if you prefer) !  Scots, Welsh and Ulstermen always get annoyed by this common mistake."
KnLsngMT5Eg,"I could never dislike a video which is uploaded by expedia!!! Epic travel guide, can't thank you enough guys. All the efforts you guys put in every video is just amazing ?"

m1ewbghHOP0,Paradise period!

m1ewbghHOP0,usa is suck beautiful heaven country its my dream country

_jFcrOvM42s,How to fly for free 
_jFcrOvM42s,1 grow wings 
_jFcrOvM42s,2 attach yourself to the aeroplane
_jFcrOvM42s,One time I got first class because they canceled our first flight
_jFcrOvM42s,The problem with busy flights is they’re always the most expensive so I try to book on less busy days to save money.
_jFcrOvM42s,The number two most left behind item is underwear!!
_jFcrOvM42s,"I love how this is an actual travel hack video. Other videos tend to say all the ""hacks"" that are pretty much common sense like ""book early for cheaper flights"" like no shit I knew that already.."
_jFcrOvM42s,"ONCE I WAS AT THE GATE THE ATTENDET TOLD US ""ANYONE WHOS WANTS TO WAIT TO THE NEXT FLIGHT WILL GET $500"" A OLD LADY GOT IT"
_jFcrOvM42s,"Roses are red,"
_jFcrOvM42s,"Violets are blue,"
_jFcrOvM42s,Hotel? Trivago.
_jFcrOvM42s,I knew you were thinking that too
_jFcrOvM42s,Does she have a twin which is Monica church
_jFcrOvM42s,“Monday morning and Friday night” I’m l leaving on a Tuesday afternoon
_jFcrOvM42s,don't book an overbooked flight on united airlines tho
_jFcrOvM42s,I'm broke. The only time I fly is when I smoke some good kush.
_jFcrOvM42s,"It's 32, end of story."
_jFcrOvM42s,dang it..
_jFcrOvM42s,DELTA: Don’t Expect Luggage To Arrive
_jFcrOvM42s,shelby's transitions have tiktok quaking
_jFcrOvM42s,Another hack is don't fly on united airlines
_jFcrOvM42s,5:04 ...”adult toys” .....mah god
_jFcrOvM42s,1:50 you look like you're going to tell us to pick the one with 32 seats left
_jFcrOvM42s,This is honestly such a dream ? 
_jFcrOvM42s,"I couldn’t imagine being able to live such a lifestyle, maybe one day! ???"
_jFcrOvM42s,"small youtuber here, who wants to support each other? ??"
_jFcrOvM42s,That music at the beginning sounded so good in my ears
_jFcrOvM42s,I love how the intro song sounds with earphones in
_jFcrOvM42s,You make me wanna travel ????
_jFcrOvM42s,"For etihad air: they overbooked a flight so 24 passangers were stranded in Abu dhabi. We couldnt get compensation for that even though they said, but we did due to EU Law 261/2004 as we departed from Manchester UK. NEVER TRUST ETIHAD WE HAD TO GET LAWYERS FOR THAT CASE"
_jFcrOvM42s,Start of this video blew my mind! Like if you were wearing headphones ?
_jFcrOvM42s,ever looked at a comment and wish you wrote it?
_jFcrOvM42s,"“Am I tall?”  Girl, I know the struggles all too well ???"
_jFcrOvM42s,I remember me and my sister have flew by ourselves for an hour and we got front seats and were the first ones on?
_jFcrOvM42s,WESTIN!! ?
_jFcrOvM42s,"My folks had a timeshare, and Westin hotels were my second home! Their lotions were LIFE!!"
_jFcrOvM42s,"This is extremely US-centric. I fly on average more than one flight per week and I have never actually been on an overbooked flight. Airlines outside of the US simply either do it much, much better; or they do it nearly as often at all."
_jFcrOvM42s,I’m flying in December over seas this really interested me ?
_jFcrOvM42s,"I interpreted the “free first class” thumbnail as using the option of a free first trial workout class at local exercise studios when traveling lol, but there you go another hack!"
_jFcrOvM42s,These hacks helped me prepare for my flight to Africa!
_jFcrOvM42s,I obsessively watch travel/packing/hacks videos.  THIS was the best/most informative video EVER!
_jFcrOvM42s,"Me and my boyfriend did hack 1 , got to the desk and the lady asked us if we wanted to get bumped to the next flight and they would pay us for us ! They basically paid for our entire holiday and spending money!!"

_jFcrOvM42s,"This video was SOOOOO helpful!! I am going on a trip to France this summer, and it is supposed to be a 10 hour plane ride!  These tips are going to help so much! Thanx! ?"
_jFcrOvM42s,Once again I love this video.  Great tips and the music is so fresh especially the intro. ?
_jFcrOvM42s,This was so helpful! Love the video!?
_jFcrOvM42s,Another Hack: if you are ever on vacation for a special event let the hotel know. So for example my husband and I were on our honeymoon and the asked what we were in Florida for and we told them our honeymoon. They upgraded up for free and gave us a free bottle of wine and one night of free room service. We originally went a little cheaper on the hotel so we would have more money for other things but because of the free upgrade we got to have a nice hotel room. It was awesome!
_jFcrOvM42s,Loved this video! Makes me want to get a passport and travel more
_jFcrOvM42s,thank you a lot becuse am gonna fly to london and its my first timr fliyng and i love you vids

_jFcrOvM42s,This video actually had some pretty good hack ideas.
_jFcrOvM42s,"I have a tip, if you check into a hotel late (around end of day, midnight) you might get upgraded to a nicer room. This has happened to me before, they automatically upgraded us to an apartment suite on the top floor. This has happened to people I know too... but I don't know if it's guaranteed though."
_jFcrOvM42s,Thanks for sharing ? This was extremely helpful ????
_jFcrOvM42s,I’m flying today on Friday night ????

_jFcrOvM42s,Sitting near the front not only allows you to get off first and all that but also gives you a smoother landing from everyone else. True fact as the front of the plane is the last part of the plane to land in general.
_jFcrOvM42s,She never said the second free way to get a first class seat

_jFcrOvM42s,On seat guru I put in my airline and it didn't come up
_jFcrOvM42s,The one of 20
_jFcrOvM42s,"There were some good tips here. I just wonder, how would you get first class dressed as you were? No offense, but airline gate staff will never upgrade someone in sweats to first class - they are instructed to find well dressed people for that. "
_jFcrOvM42s,"I have been bumped (involuntarily) from a flight going home from Europe. I got monetary compensation, but certainly not first class (and I was well dressed). But it did basically pay for almost my whole airfare round trip. They put us up in a hotel for overnight (a decent one too!) and food voucher. But was that really worth the inconvenience of leaving the next day, having to endure a flight with yet another stopover and extremely tight connection - plus put my luggage on the wrong flight? Not really, IMO. "
_jFcrOvM42s,Idk why I’m watching this
_jFcrOvM42s,I don’t leave my. House
_jFcrOvM42s,I always have TSA PreCheck
_jFcrOvM42s,ok just found this video and holy crap that hairstyle completely changes how you look compared to now xD
_jFcrOvM42s,your good !!!!! thank you !!!
_jFcrOvM42s,"Excellent advice! As a frequent solo flyer I've got my routine down to perfection, got all my medicine and necessities in bags and when I get on the plane I put in earplugs, Bose noice cancelling above that with soothing music, put on a sleep mask, grab a pillow and a blanket and I'm OUT. Just remember to tell the flight attendant if you want to be woken up for food or not. "
_jFcrOvM42s,My parents have status. I never really understood it. My dad is a firefighter and we are always in first class.
_jFcrOvM42s,Hack number 12: Don’t book spirit
_jFcrOvM42s,Just the fact that I don't have to take off my shoes is worth it to get TSA precheck :D
_jFcrOvM42s,I remember when I was Video Recording in the Airport. A Security Guard got mad and said no that's not allowed. Then I took out my wallet then went BOOOOOM!!!! Security Guard License that Owens a Business. Told that Guard off he looked embarrassed and walked away Lol.
_jFcrOvM42s,Hack #11 don't ride united airlines
_jFcrOvM42s,"Hey Shelby, I’m planning on a very long flight with probably multiple stops, I was wondering if you had any tricks for getting cheeper flights or just more tricks in general. Thanks :)"
_jFcrOvM42s,2:00 is that sometimes by crush??
_jFcrOvM42s,I am going to Egypt ?? tomorrow!!!!!!! Uhhhhh I am soo excited ?!!!
_jFcrOvM42s,Another life hack is high priority staff travel o:

_jFcrOvM42s,Let's be honest: Now I'm always gonna call the front desk so I can get free chargers
_jFcrOvM42s,im going to the furthest country away from the netherland so i can get so much credit
_jFcrOvM42s,"I absolutely love Alaska airlines. I’ve flown with them and every single time they are fantastic. My friend had another flight that she was going to be late for, they let her get off the plane before anyone else so she could run to catch it. They are super helpful. The only issue is the weird people I always seem to fly with ugh!"
_jFcrOvM42s,what song was playing at the end before outtakes??
_jFcrOvM42s,You stayed at the Westin and right now I am in the Westin hotel lying in their beds. Hahah
_jFcrOvM42s,How to get free stuff- be an attractive (mid 20s) female
_jFcrOvM42s,TSA PRE?? is $85 for 5 years just a heads up
_jFcrOvM42s,"Most times people speaking of first class it is business. The first class is offered by airlines when you travel long distance, overseas."
_jFcrOvM42s,I thought there was 20 seats booked but turns out 
_jFcrOvM42s,THERE ARE 20 SEATS LEFT
_jFcrOvM42s,(MAYBE)
_jFcrOvM42s,I always use my tv to charge my phone
_jFcrOvM42s,I always have best experience on American.....professional staff...no mind games
_jFcrOvM42s,20 ? seat flight
_jFcrOvM42s,"I am a front Office Supervisor for Marriott hotels and if you ask for an upgrade at check in if the hotel is not sold out and your nice most likely you will get the upgrade. Also I would stay away from third party reservations. Your room type is never guaranteed through them and if you have a bad experience the hotel can't offer any type of discount off your rate because it was booked from an outside source. The reason why we can't take any money off the rate is because the rate is determined by the 3rd party reservation website and they are the only people who can adjust rates on reservations booked through them and not the hotel. Also I always tell people to try and call the hotel first. Most of the time they will agree to match the rate you see online from a 3rd party reservation website (Expedia, Priceline, etc) because then the hotel does not have to pay these companies commission which saves the hotel money. "
_jFcrOvM42s,05:09:00 AM

_jFcrOvM42s,"Awesome hacks! I was approached to give up my seat from Barcelona to miami for $600 credit and a free airport hotel stay 2 weeks ago. I really considered it but then opted out. I was tired, I had a stomach bug and really wanted to go home. I should’ve taken it though; one extra day in Spain! But wasn’t meant to be.  TSA precheck is the best!"
_jFcrOvM42s,"You yanks have some unusual things such as bumped off flights and crazy security , don't think I'd like to live there ."

_jFcrOvM42s,"Would you say delta is the airline to go to? Also, do you have a delta credit card? Or just acquire credit like you mentioned in the video?"
_jFcrOvM42s,"I got first class for free cuz I fly standby. On a flight from San Fran to Vegas, they asked if anyone wanted to upgrade and no one did, so they chose the top standby and it happened to be my mom and I."

_jFcrOvM42s,"What airlines do you use? It is very rare for me to find an overbooked airplane even though it's very cheap. I used to fly easyjet and Ryanair when I was in Europe, but they are not exactly 'overbooked'. The one I can think of off my experience is scoot (My flight to Japan), however they won't compensate for it so if you're late then everything goes to shit! HAHA. Well thanks for the wonderful info though, I will try to be informative on my channel as well xD"

There was a person that was disabled and had to be switched rows, and so my family and I moved to the A, B, C side of the plane, also on the first row. These were the seats by the entrance to the plane. It turns out, I’m too young to ride in the front of the plane. Luckily, the flight wasn’t overbooked and so they moved us back. We got free drinks, foods and literally whatever we wanted. We did it even need it. It was a great flight"

_jFcrOvM42s,"MAN, when I did the precheck, I went on the computer, registered, had to drive WAY into the downtown area to a little office area, they collected a lot of info from me, fingerprinted me, gave me an interview, I had to pay $80, IIRC, and then wait for  weeks, IIRC.  If they approve you, you get a KTID {Known Traveler ID).  If they don't, they say sorry, but NO REFUNDS!  BTW At least with delta, they at least USED to give people that were gold or above FREE PRECHECK!"

_jFcrOvM42s,I heard (I'm not sure if it's true) that people closer to the front of the plane are more likely to die in a plane crash than someone in the middle or back.

_jFcrOvM42s,"For upgrades, flying with an airline you're a frequent flyer of and being one of the last people to the gate has gotten me upgraded several times. Enjoy the lounge for a little longer and then get a free 12h business class experience is.... quite nice"
_jFcrOvM42s,Hotel heck for the roller bed... as someone with experience in hotel industry. DON'T DO IT as some hotels charge you for the bed!  Check thoroughly!
_jFcrOvM42s,We fly on delta
_jFcrOvM42s,Well for me a typical flight would be 13 hours minimum (I live in Hong Kong but travel to the UK for work and family several times a year).
_jFcrOvM42s,Getting bumped might now make too much difference to a 2 hour flight but trust me it fucking sucks to step off an essentially delayed flight and walk straight into a meeting having not slept for 30 hours as though nothing happened.
_jFcrOvM42s,thumbs up!

_jFcrOvM42s,"If you want to be upgraded, it helps to be on the back row of seats.  If the flight is fairly empty, the cabin crew will be thinking that this is a much more comfortable place for them to sit than the fold down seats they get."
_jFcrOvM42s,Hotel Tonight is Da Best!
_jFcrOvM42s,What’s the website to book the flight?
_jFcrOvM42s,20 duh

_jFcrOvM42s,"On Virgin Atlantic the international flight was overbooked so they offered me a hotel for the night and a free international ticket (or 40,000 miles) to volunteer to take the next flight (in 24 hours). It was great because I could spend an extra night on holiday and I got a free ticket which I used to fly to my cousin's wedding."
_jFcrOvM42s,Another tip is if you bring your PS4 with you you can charge your phone headphones etc. you just need the cable

_jFcrOvM42s,What camera are you using to shoot?
_jFcrOvM42s,"Oh and one more hack - pick your seats early and then as you get closer to fly day, check the seat selection again - there are sometimes single seats freed up at the front of the plane with late changes - switch seats then to move up to a better row closer to the front."
_jFcrOvM42s,Hotel?
_jFcrOvM42s,"I used to travel all 2-3 times per month some of which was international. Was always a blessing when they would come to you in the main cabin and said they have reassigned you to a very low row number :-P , I have accrued almost a million miles on Delta, 500k on American the remaining ones I lost track of. Once you get married, travel is no longer as much fun when you travel alone. Good tips."
_jFcrOvM42s,I'm going to Guatemala soon.

_jFcrOvM42s,"I highly recommend, when you need to book a hotel last minute to call directly the front desk, like the hotel number and tell them you'd like the room but it's too expensive for what's worth it. then you tell them that they could give it to you for less or risk it and have it vacant. most of the times they lower the prices :) also if you go there in person, but that's harder for many people because you need to look comfortable and relaxed and also have a plan B in case it doesn't work."

_jFcrOvM42s,"There are times where people don’t show up. So there’s just 1 row of free seats. I’ve always been lucky, if I don’t enjoy my seat. An airplane attendant immediately says“you can pick seats from here!” So I get a choice.?"

_jFcrOvM42s,Hi
_jFcrOvM42s,"Actually two things, I work in Hotels. First if you need a rollaway  it can't be in a room with 2 bed because if  fire safety . second if you book through a 3rd party, most of the time you won't get anything special and typically will get put in the worst room. Also  lets say you have an issue with room , they can't discount it."
_jFcrOvM42s,Do not fly Frontier.
_jFcrOvM42s,I went on SeatGuru and now i'm really anxious to see my seat is a 'bad' one. I chose the back window seat so there's no chance of people kicking me and I can put it back as far as I want without thinking i'm moving someones food. But it says bad because it's near the 'galley' and toilets
_jFcrOvM42s,This was so helpful--- the best travel life hack vid I've ever seen!!

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Strong production quality. I consider Attache one of the more high end Vlogs.

DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I just laughed at fact ""only 14 euro on way"" :D when you fly from enywhere in EU like I did, I paid 20 for air ticket and then 28 for train and I found it pretty steep. Just funny remark :)"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,You can also  take a 5 euro bus to/ from Termini to Fiumicino airport.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"RIP to Anthony Bourdain. Gave me chills when that popped up as one of the two books who encouraged you to travel. Favorite travel book? Dude, you are my travel book."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,best guide ever thank you
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Thank you GOD for making me an Italian.  Tragically, I am gluten intolerant------but there is risotto!?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I just visited Italy for the first time last April, loved it. I visited over 10 cities, and I must say it's a tie between Rome and the Sorrento coast for the best. As always, spot on video."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"8:49 when Alex finally said to himself, ""Enough talking about Supplì al Telefono. This boy's gotta eat. Like. RIGHT. NOW."""

DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Your videos have inspired me to travel around the world. I've been to LA, San Francisco, New York, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Singapore. I have a trip planned to Hong Kong, Thailand and Dubai in December. Thank you for amazing high quality travel videos. There's non like it on YouTube! Huge South African Fan!!"

DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Love the Chanel! Love the idea of using vintage film effect, but when using it with food, sometimes it seems like (especially when looking at it from a distance) there are flies around the food. Also, wondering if there are any festivals in or near Rome, in a certain time of the year, that are worth going."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This was one of my favorite attaché videos. The creators seemed to have a lot of fun making it.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Wherever I travel, I always look for an Attaché video first."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Rome is amazing. I only spent a brief time there a few years ago, but I'm so excited for the possibility of going back."

On the bill, there is often a coperto (cover charge) per person, which is usually around 2 euros each. If this is the case, there is no need to tip!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This is ingenious  to put Phoenix on the soundtrack of the video!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I walked all over Rome. Was very aware of my surroundings but I felt safe. Miss Rome

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Yay! A new attache video! I'm a happy camper :)
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Love the video. Though can you reduce your AD segment. It is very distracting.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Just went to Rome! Thumbs up for your vid! Really love it.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,what is the song you used in 9:57?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Another good one. Need to remember to validate tickets?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Alex, thanks for this video! This travel vlog is one of the best.  You are head and shoulders above the rest.  As well, I have to check out that audio book you mentioned - ""Around the World in 80 days"".  :)"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Loved the video! I'd just like to add one thing though.. while in the city, we were warned by the hotel staff to not wander around on foot in the later hours of evening, especially the areas around the Colosseum, for fears of mugging and street crimes. We were also told to be careful of pickpockets by the local street vendors."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Hellloooo!!! thanks for the amazing video! I just looked into Rome for October 2019, and can't belive how cheap it is for flight & hotel for 6 or 7 nights. any reason why it's so cheap? Any suggested hotel to stay at for married couple, no kids?? Thank you so much!"

DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You're hot, Alex :P"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I had honestly never considered Rome until watching your video. Now my bucket list is longer. Try reading The Masked Rider by Neil Peart.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This is very good! Lots of useful information and great shots of Rome.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,great watch!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Nice video! ??????

DnL-zJ5DcQw,LOVE LOVE LOVE your videos buddy! Please don't ever stop making them!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Great video! About tips, I have read that some tourist restaurants do a service charge on top of your total, and still expect a tip, is that correct?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,hi do you do your own edits? i like the grainy effect.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,What’s the song playing at 9:50 ?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You have to go the Naples(Best pizza ever) Capri, Amalfi, Ischia e Mergellina .."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,love it! any chance  you're doing stockholm next!

DnL-zJ5DcQw,This is a great travel video with a lot of information which a traveler will need and what I like the most of it is the way you made this video a professional travel guide.

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Roma Capvt Mvndi! A beautiful video.Complimenti!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You were right. Everything changed after Tokyo. I watch your new videos and without trying, I'm comparing these cities to Tokyo. And none of them come close."

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Song name at 0:41?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Good Guide !
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Best video yet. Wondering if you guys could do New York part 2. Visited in April but only stayed in Manhattan. I would love to see what the boroughs have to offer!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Bc this has been everywhere
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Omg I’m a third thru this and is it about Rome or “public transportation in Rome”?? Uuuugh
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Nothing makes me happier than seeing a new Attache review popup on my feed. Thanks Alex & team!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Is it the editing, or are there a lot of flies in Rome?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Can you go to Osaka next :)
DnL-zJ5DcQw,:3
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Most beautiful city in Europe
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Like all great empires, it's history now."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I’ve been to Bella Roma so many times! Either you get and breathe in and merge with the soul of this fantastic city or you just thinks it’s a pile of antique garbage. I just love everything about Rome. The smell, the people, every turn you make there’s a new scenery that’s fantastic.  "
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I like the Art Bell background music
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"have been watching for ages now and LOVE you and your videos but in contrast to the beginning of this vid, have no interest at ALL in Rome?!?! weird?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Honestly the most helpful Rome travel video
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Beautiful city
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"""tightly packed historic center"", are you joking? From villa borghese to Piazza del popolo it is entirely historical, and larger than the entire city of Paris (the city borders not Metropolitan area). This area would still exclude half of Rome's unesco sites."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,amazing video
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Great job ? Nice tour video.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,rip anthony bourdain
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"If you're ever in Amsterdam again, i'd love to meet you!i love your show. I just moved here as a student and i'd love to meet a fellow travel lover :)"

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Great videography. Enjoyable to watch.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I get the idea for these videos but Rome has a work industry?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Awesome video, thank you!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Essential travel book is “The Art of Travel” by Alain de Botton. This uses the thoughts of a series of philosophers to examine the ‘why’ of travel. 
DnL-zJ5DcQw,can you put the names of the songs you used in this video? esp from 9:40. my fav traveling books are from rick steves because it gives a comprehensive cultural experience
DnL-zJ5DcQw,You are so well spoken and all ?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Oh, Alex.. you are too good looking and I can't  pay attention to what you're saying..  It's frustrating..."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"hi, i'm from Rome, I appreciated all the thing you said on Rome, but remeber rome was founded on seven hills so it's one of the less flat city in europe, for this reason in Rome we don't use bike, scooter or skate because it would be tiring. Pablo."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I just love the videos you and your husband make. Your performance in every video is spot on and your husband edits the video perfectly. Dynamic Duo!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Rome, Italy, South Asia, Surrounded by land and sea, Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, EYE SUMBERONO 2838,"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Universes Lobby, Universes"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Very loooooong video!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Big fan of your channel, would very much like to see videos made the way the LA one was made and get an insider's view of cities."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"if i buy one bus ticket then i can go from A to B then take another bus to go C to D,  if it take less than 100 minutes?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,How many days is enough in Rome to see the tourist places
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This guy reminds me of the actor Jared Harris
DnL-zJ5DcQw,please make video for switzerland
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I always travel alone,I hope to find someone there in Rome who can guide me all throughout my plan trip there,, I'm dying to see Rome, everything in Italy..."

DnL-zJ5DcQw,less commercials please. we dont need to know who sponsors you
DnL-zJ5DcQw,You hardly show the city or the food. It's all about the host and him showing off. Rome is lovely city with soo much to see but more than 90% of the video is just the host. Not nice!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Any of the books by Neil Peart.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Bolt is cheaper then ALL i found Bolt when in Vienna   cheap rides ! i will never use a Taxi again

DnL-zJ5DcQw,So this is where Bourdain really went
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"This is the most useful travel video I've found! Short and very interesting form, condensed to the most important stuff with a solid topping of a good humor. It's a nice change from most of the ""professional"" travel videos made in the tone of North Korean news :) Great job!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Also, have you considered visiting Krakow?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Do Miami or Chicago next.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Awesome vid!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,When are you doing São Paulo??
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"My country, my pride. Viva l’Italia, sempre e comunque!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Are there a lot of flies in this video?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Love your videos.  Found them when looking for info about Mumbai for a trip earlier this year.  Got free audio book!  Michael Palin did a great job on his world trip.  Not really a travel book but loved ""A year in Provence"" by Peter Mayle."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,The Word pizza originate from   the greek ”????” (PITTA) that means pie? 
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Greeting from Carthage
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I know this was years ago but my favourite travel book is called ‘you’ve gone too far this time sir’. It’s about a teacher who decided to go to India but because he was teaching global warming to his kids he realised he shouldn’t take a plane.....so he rode a bike from England to India, took him around half a year or more and it is hilarious"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Hi Mr Alex Hunter. Your videos are really very informative & shows the in and out of the best places. I have subscribed your channel just bcoz it's so good. Just wanted to let you know that viewers also want to see the city not just food, money or transport although it's very essential to know but wanted a city tour ( monuments, history, people, culture etc). One thing more , I love your watch ? . Keep up the good work. Cheers"

I can't wait to see you on the Travel Channel! - Cheers! - Chris."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Hold on to your wallet when you get in and out of a subway.  That's when they make an attempt to pick your pocket.  Don't put your wallet in your back pocket.   They know Tourists have cash.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Great video as usual
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"The monocle guide to better living, and all of the monocle guides to specific cities are well worth the reads-great at finding the best non-tourist spots! Great show as always!"

DnL-zJ5DcQw,"YES LOVED THIS ATtaCHE you deserve so many more views, us small youtubers don’t get the recognition !! really really nice video ! dropped you a like because i enjoyed it so much ,can i ask what the song is ? keep them coming !!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,ROMA TERMINI! I got off the train thinking it was Roma Tiburtina and I watched my group of 30 people leave me behind... haha
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Simply put...outstanding quality
DnL-zJ5DcQw,dude talks about pizza for 5 minutes?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Can you guys do Macao next
DnL-zJ5DcQw,dude why is there so much of you on this video? I can listen to your words while looking at food and the city. why do you make us see your face almost 80% of the time? add more b-role! make it pretty!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,ave SSL 1900
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Okay but where is that place that he was eating at for the opening shot of “food”. With the wine, olives, and meat?!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Come here in Manila.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Hard to pick a favorite travel book but one is Blue Highways, by William Least Heat-Moon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Highways"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I’m from Rome, did you really say that public transportation is good? Ahahahhahahaha sometimes I wait for the bus for 30 minutes (I’m 14 and in my life I’ve seen ticket staff like 4 times)"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I just love watching your Trip reports .. They r different from those normal boring Trip reports .. I love the fact that u include each and every aspect i.e Transportation , where to eat etc. It does help a lot to first time tourists .. Keep the Good work on .. ?.. from a big Indian fan ???"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Your reviews are a joy.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Please do Cairo travel guide !!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Really low-brow Rome 101 for the totally clueless.  Food chapter is just plain dumb.  Nothing about the great architecture or history or experience, just dumb-down blather.   I wouldn't want this guy to tell me anything!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Wonderful show. Alex, you are such a good presenter, no wonder you are also a speaker. Very funny, informative, easy on the eyes and ears. (Nice glasses, btw). Greg does a brilliant job with the camera and the editing. I'm hooked."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Love your shows mate. My only wish is you would drink more and sample a bit more nightlife
DnL-zJ5DcQw,What's the music at 9.50?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"It’s funny that you even have to mention that places like the Olive Garden are crap. But, depending on ones experience it might not be obvious."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"This, giallo, chilly, ambient, hop,  soundtrack, what is it?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"favourite travel book: Uncommon Wisdom by Fritjof Capra, because he talks to avant-garde thinkers all over the world. But I guess it's not a travel book per-se."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Love your videos. But i hope for new series in 2018 you'll give more info on the city other than the transport to and from airport. Costs of the beer and a big Mac.after watching the same format for most of the videos,it tends to be kindda boring. There's a lot to say about a city other than those same format. Anyway look forward for new season and hopefully with new look and format."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Roman Empire a kingdom?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I love your videos and use them as our travel guides.  However, I would like to point something out in this video.  at 7:51 mark, the lady selling what looks like Chinese Egg Pancake, is this in Rome?...:)"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You and Greg are probably the cutest couple ever, he should come out from behind the camera every once in a while!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Prefect video.. in your video’s could you tell us if exchanging dollars for euros (or whatever country) is it better to do it in the USA or wait til you get there.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"you asked for travel books. One of my favs, an oldie but so charming, French Lessons by Peter Mayle. It inspired me to actually buy that plane ticket years ago. Thank you for the awesome videos. The high quality and practical advice is priceless. Coincidently, we were in Rome just before you filmed this one last year :) man was it hot!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"If anyone is going to Rome to eat at MC, they're doing VERY VERY WRONG!?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Sooo, how’s the state of the kickstarter?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"This is a professional guide, however if someone interested in a video and travel guide that created young couple feel free to watch my video or simply read article at astraveler.com "
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Once again thanks for this video!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,whats is with the bugs?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Who saw the Illuminati in 16:44
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Wooh thanks again Alex, BTW try a Canadian city Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. Each has something different to offer."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,For travelling there are also 48 or 72 hour Roma Pass. Free travel in the duration including free acces to a number of attraction.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Barbarian came to rome!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Hey Alex , my husband an i enjoyed Duff McKagan's book ''How to be a man (and other illusions) ''this guy , as you know GNR member gives great guide lines on how to behave out of the borders LOL"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Craving for a Roman Holiday
DnL-zJ5DcQw,please come to punjab(india)
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Amazing....  But one small suggestion,  the effect you guys have used while showing the fooood..  I personally didn't like that effect,  it looks like flies are over the food.  Hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say. That effect was taking off the feel."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Why do you whisper when you narrate? Video is very good, but get someone else to speak."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,You forgot the Coperto and all that weird sort-of tipping stuff
DnL-zJ5DcQw,please do Istanbul !
DnL-zJ5DcQw,C A I R O
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Really do love this channel mostly, but got some problems with this Rome video."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"First: You begin with your typical assertion that the [fill in the blank] major city has COMPREHENSIVE public transportation that is really easy to use. Then you spend 8 minutes describing the ins-and-outs of when and where to punch tickets on this or that mode of transport. Sometimes before you get on, sometimes after, sometimes in the station, sometimes not. And all those variation of ticket purchases. Yada yada Yeah, real easy. Why don't you skip all the boilerplate, and just admit the truth, that the learning curve of major European city transport is a pain in the ass. PERSONAL NOTE: I followed some of your ""can't miss"" transport advice in London and Berlin... and it did not work out for me. Heathrow to Paddington to Picadilly... ugh... should have taken the cab. And Berlin... puh leeze... ticket machines covered in graffiti and ZERO personnel to ask a question of and everything spread out in the dirty sprawl of stations still under construction. What a joke. And so on, and so on."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I have diabetes and I need to use the bathroom a lot do they have bathrooms I buy the Colosseum
DnL-zJ5DcQw,thriller author of NINTH CAR at amazon.com books sez: Hard to do justice to The World's Greatest City. Just be mindful of motorcycles when you're out walking: They can come up on you quickly on these curving and narrow streets. And things have become MUCH more $ since the switch to the euro.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,So the ticket validation is required while traveling on buses and trams. No need on metros.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Why should i not be seen as a tourist, i mean everybody gets IT after the first Word comes out of my mouth.."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Vagabonding by Rolf Potts
DnL-zJ5DcQw,should i hold cash in rome or does most places accept card?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I‘ve been to rome countless times and i gave to say your travel guide is the best i found on youtube so far. Short. Well shot and has all the infos a tourist needs (esp with the public transport) rome can be very overwhelming especially in may/june and august/september,where millions of toueits cram into the tiny alleys and streets.  your guide helps people enjoying the city despite the tourists masses."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You should order the food, including cappuccinos, that you like and enjoy and not be such a slave to the opinions of strangers. If it’s on the menu and served at the time you are there, it can be ordered.  Low brow is an ugly concept."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,FIRST
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Come to Lahore,Pakistan it has lot to offer :)"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,MC DO? hot healthy food. Don't promote it.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,How does this vid get 131 thumbs downs?? Folks must be bored or just plain evil....
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Do New Delhi
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Sorry but that suppli` looks 3 days old and fried in something resembling cornflakes.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Please tell people not to order a ""Latte"", they will get a glass of milk - you need to order a Caffe Latte or Caffe Americano!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Go to Seoul
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Do Sydney Next
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Venezia?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Excellent cultural and historical narrative.....good filming and editing.....you are a very ""professional"" presenter.....almost ""too refined and polished"" for a ""YouTube"" travel vlog!L.o.l.  I enjoyed your style and delivery very much....probably because I am not a ""20 something year old"" YouTube travel vlogger and viewer!L.o.l."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Too many pickpockets on public transportation.We just walked everywhere. Or took taxis on long distances. We travel off season. Not so many awful tourists.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Rome has to be the most beautiful city in Europe. Food is excelent, climate is great, you've got plenty to visit and to learn about...Only problem is the ""multi culturalism"" that you can actually see the horrors around Termini station."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Wow he is so sexy
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"This is one of the best, if not the best, video about my city. Simple yet complete with all the info needed to wander around Rome freely. And on the food side, be sure to drink one of the local naturally sparkling water like Nepi or Egeria. It has a unique taste, quite different from classic sparkling water."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,im a fan of the videos. However can you incorporate more things to do and see in the videos. I think most people know how to work uber or get trains or metro.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Please visit Toronto
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"This was great, only one thing was wrong. There is no Uber in Italy, it's illegal"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I couldn't understand English 90%, but I can say Roma is wonderful."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I live in corpus christi and i had to drive 5,284 miles, 6 boats and 8 trains and 14 buses. That was long"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I will go to Alaska. It took 4,937 miles only in car. I went to Hawaii. I took 18 boats"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I went to Antarctica. It took 21 boats, 2 trains and 9,994 miles"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Well you got that right, Rome is definitley on my list, perhaps just a lil behind Venice and Naples mind you ? what say you to Madrid, Valencia (so under-appreciated in my opinion) or maybe even a London Part 2 seeing as all the New Yorkers are getting in on the calls for a NYPT2 ? wherever you decide to go, I'll be waiting for uploads ?"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Pizza bianca + mortadella = nirvana
DnL-zJ5DcQw,HAHA! I bathe in your bath of American disappointment...
DnL-zJ5DcQw,YAY
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Is there a specific reason why it is considered a faux pas to order a cappuccino after a meal? Does this protocol also apply to espresso? Why is there a protocol to drink something anytime of day that one loves to drink?
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This is not a mozzarella stick it's art
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"More points to add. 1. The train tickets are always cheaper on the machines and cost a Euro or 2 more at the counters. So beware. 2. Roma Pass helps ease the lines at Museums or specially the Colosseum. 3. For the Vatican, or any other attraction, have a ticket booked online, because lines are terrible. Thanks @Attache for doing this."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Rome is mind blowing but be aware of pickpockets n thieves in touristy places...
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Gosh I love European cities.  The history, architecture, and beauty.  I wish United States had beautiful cities.  American cities suck and have ALOT of crime.  But i will say America has beautiful natural scenery."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Finally, a Rome travel guide not hosted by idiots.  Great production values, presentation, and knowledge base.  The beat-to-heck film stock look gets old after a while but that's a small quibble. You guys are the best."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Be aware that even though it' true that Rome is kinda safe, it's a bit risky going alone in the night, especially if you're not caucasian or male and pickpockets and scammers are everywhere, especially on public transportations, so be extra careful! It's not very LGBT friendly too. Avoid taxi if you can (they'll almost certainly try to get advance by the fact that you are a tourist), but if you can't, at least always check if the taximeter is switched on."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"The Big Mac price comparison is super cringe-worthy, especially after describing for us the amazing food one could be eating."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I haven't read a travel book but I travelled on faith, I think I purchased lonely planet on a Kindle but I lost it :) I read some random pages but people had fun within a 100 m radius when I travelled. Yes I travelled alone, wrote some travel blogs etc. I used to crack good jokes with locals."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I don't have a fav travel book, i generally just hit google for suggestions - or youtube, where Attache is definitely at the top of my list. I'll be monitoring the comments for travel book suggestions! Kudos to you both! While it may not be at the top of your metropolitan cities list, if you ever make it to my home town of Hobart, Tasmania, lemme know!"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I got into Rome and got scam by taxi.  Your video travel tip is gold or people would get a scam like me.  The old man told me:  Euro: 148.00. because I did not take the white color taxi.  
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I was tried to buy sim card around the exit--- the guy helped me out and tell me only $50.00, then he handed me over other guy,  and other guy, then Taxi----They asked:  if this was my first time in Rome. I stupidly answer: Yes.  He knew he was scamming me...he won't even drop me off in front of my hotel.... It was Sunday, I did not have money exchange into EURO..."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"You forgot to mention how dirty, grimey, and unclean the city of Rome is, thats full of graffiti on nearly every wall in every street. If you dont psychically force yourself to use any pedestrian crossing you will be standing there all day and half way crossing still be alert as most cars will not stop. The worse thing about Rome is the street sellers that are everywhere. 5 or 6 on every street trying to sell you any crap they have, or at the famous landmarks tricking you into buying a fast track ticket or map or again a piece of cheap crap, and even placing a necklace or bracelet around your neck or arm and then asking for money. The landmarks are amazing and once inside they are breathtaking but the rest of Rome is a real let down and needs alot of work to make it a great city like London"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"To avoid having to take public transport, split your accommodation based on the areas you will be visiting. For example if you wish to spend 2 days visiting the Vatican, stay those days in the Prati area, then another few days near the Spanish Steps and the remainder in the Trastevere. Staying very near these places allows you to walk to all the sights in the area and also the advantage of getting up really early, taking a short casual stroll and viola you have major spots to yourself (with very few people about)."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Rome is not flat
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Rome is my favourite city in the world and you have captured it better than anyone else. The key is walking and spending the time. June 2018 will be our 7th visit and we will spend 14 days  there out of our 5 week Italian trip. New wonders around every corner.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,You are annoying
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Rome is not flat.
DnL-zJ5DcQw,This is why I go to sicilia (Sicily)
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Sorry, I see Greece at the top.  Italy 2nd and France 3rd."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Germany will always be my white knight!!
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"It’s not a travel book per se, but there is an author, Tim Parks (born in England, Harvard Ph D, teaching in university in northern Italy), who is an expat with over 30 years in Italy. Among his long list of works are books about life in Italy through the eyes of an expat. They’re fabulous reads, filled with wit, insight and humor. I suggest reading ‘Italian Ways’ to start."
DnL-zJ5DcQw,I heard Italians dislikes Chinese people
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"Do Israel, like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv"
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Try Constantinople it is a huge city you may like it especially St. Sophia is one of the greatest buildings of eastern roman empire
DnL-zJ5DcQw,Let me guess British journalist as usual for traveling research

DnL-zJ5DcQw,Less food next time pls....
DnL-zJ5DcQw,"I was in Italy last month. There is an ISIS attack daily on police there. So many immigrants were allowed in, that they also let in thousands of ISIS militants too. This will happen to america if we let everyone in. Italy was the most horrible people I had ever met, so rude, so angry, even the cash register girls at gas stations look angry at you when paying for items. Horrible people, but beautiful country. "
DnL-zJ5DcQw,? for all the advertising 
N8bHCHl8X_0,"I first visited Lisbon & Porto in 1994, with my - then girlfriend from NYC. Both cities were diamonds in the rough back then...poor, and ramshackle - like Havana. I returned in 1996 - alone, and stayed 6 months. I had fallen under Lisbon's spell, and felt then that the city would be ""Discovered"" again, and Man! - was that a prescient thought! I returned again in 2008, and 2009, and the changes were Phenomenal! I have not been back since, but from most of my Portuguese friends I hear that the city is firing on ALL Cylinders, and yet - Tourism is beginning to erode the Portuguese Way of Life! Madonna has apparently purchased a small palace in Sintra, and property in Lisbon, so... you know the ""Hand of Doom"" is looming over Portugal in a way not seen since the 1755 Earthquake! I love the place like no other, and hope to live there again. My suggestion to Travelers who wish to experience this still magical place - DO NOT act like uninformed, spoilt brats!......"
N8bHCHl8X_0,Lisboa é a história! Um dia quero conhecer essa cidade tão fofa. Abraços de São Paulo Brasil!
N8bHCHl8X_0,"“Try to keep this one to seven minutes, okay."" These are the words our production manager routinely dispenses as our team embark on a new destination guide. One look at the footage of Lisbon, however, and we quickly realized there was zero chance of a seven minute video. In fact we had a hard time bringing this one in at under fifteen! Well, there's always next time. Until then, come with us and explore Portugal's incredible capital; a place where beauty, tradition, creativity and adventure knows no limit."
N8bHCHl8X_0,Nobody knows how I love Lisboa. Greetings from the Dominican Republic.

N8bHCHl8X_0,"1. Accommodation: It is impossible to find a mid level priced hotel. Like our other trips, Air B&B' s are a good option; however, be prepared for chilly nights and mornings as most places have heaters but are not insulated. The Canadians were cold...yes we said it."
N8bHCHl8X_0,???? ?? ????????

N8bHCHl8X_0,my dream city is Lisbon
N8bHCHl8X_0,I must visit it in my life
N8bHCHl8X_0,"Visited Lisbon in summer 2019.  Was absolutely spellbound by the hilltop views of the city and by the castles in Sintra.  And those egg tarts were crazy addictive.  The tile work on the walls of the buildings in Lisbon (as well as Porto) are absolutely gorgeous.  There's a lot of steep hills to navigate so bring good walking shoes, but so compact that you can cover lots of ground in a short time.  And the seafood in Lisbon is top notch (and super affordable).  I saw shockingly few American tourists there compared to elsewhere in western Europe, but was warmly received by every Lisboeta I encountered.  Portugal is truly the most underrated European country I've been to thusfar."
N8bHCHl8X_0,Portugal the city of language of Portuguese to here from Brazil.
N8bHCHl8X_0,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
N8bHCHl8X_0,"Good afternoon. I'm sorry, I made this request yesterday, but there was a problem on the page that I created and I have to ask, again, a favor. Do you mind if I use your promotional video, a professional training course I'm attending in I. E. F. P. de Alcantara? is merely for training use, without any promotional use and I even thought about editing it to shorten. Without more time and thanking you in advance for their attention. With best regards, Carlos Ferreira."

N8bHCHl8X_0,"Expedia please visit to Pakistan. Natural beauty is waiting for you, world second most beautifull capital Islamabad, Northeren Areas, Gilgit Baltistan, KPK and AJK....... Heavens on the Earh."
N8bHCHl8X_0,When I was a child I used to play for hours and never got tired. But now I cannot even run 2 miles. The pollution released for vehicles has seriously degraded air quality over the years.
N8bHCHl8X_0,Music is kind of annoying! It shouldn't be louder than the narrator.
N8bHCHl8X_0,algeria
N8bHCHl8X_0,"Nelson Correia: Easily the best place to drink good beer. Lots of variety, including from most of the recent Portuguese craft breweries, a cosy atmosphere brewpubs, breweries and more. to visit or drink but I don't Europe's oldest independent capital city is finally embracing the craft booze-fest. Portugal is not a country particularly noted for its drinking culture altough they can be noted as one of the coolest European Citys."
N8bHCHl8X_0,"5:10 ""The earthquake also shook the city free of religious dogmas of old"" Did not expect to find such a violent anti religious message in a travel video... also incredibly ignorant"
N8bHCHl8X_0,"Sou brasileiro, descendentes de bisavós portugueses e espero um dia ir ao país em especial Lisboa, a capital, porém não posso deixar de dizer que o terremoto português que avastou a cidade no século XVIII, teve sua reconstrução financiada graças ao ciclo do ouro aqui no Brasil, tá."
N8bHCHl8X_0,"I liked lisbon,,,but the music so.... Bore!that lose anything"
N8bHCHl8X_0,Don't go there too many tourists even in Winter

T18b3nG9Vfo,"""experiences that money can't buy"" but can be yours for only $160,000 ..."
T18b3nG9Vfo,dont move to HK trust me. my HK bed room is the size of North American Toilet.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Money can't buy experiences? GTFO
T18b3nG9Vfo,Im not going to HK to enjoy French cuisine and sip on Krug....I want to enjoy HONG KONG!
T18b3nG9Vfo,"You forgot to mention that this city has one of the worst wealth gap on Earth, with THE most expensive housing on Earth. Millions of people living in miserable conditions, anything from a family of three living in 300 ft. apartments (that's called lower middle class), tiny closet-sized apartments or literal cages"
T18b3nG9Vfo,Poor reporting.  CNBC either didn't know or failed to mention that the helicopter pilot was famous Hong Kong actor Michael Wong.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Hongkong is Rich city but has many poor people .
T18b3nG9Vfo,"When I lived in Hong Kong as a son of a diplomat I had a friend who’s dad was a high level executive in the financial sector, my friend had his birthday parties on a yacht in the harbor complete with a gold leaf covered cake. And this was for elementary school kids!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,The way d presenter walks is such a turn off.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"That helicopter guy, isnt he a Hong Kong actor?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Something i really don't understand about getting hotel rooms with gyms, huge flat screen tv, etc. I mean if you are a tourist, you are supposed to be enjoying ""outside"" and not the ""inside of your hotel"". I would rather pay good money to be surrounded by happy people, strong wine and beautiful women."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Meanwhile, there are still Hong Kong residents living in cage apartments and homes."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Experiences money can't buy, ill take two lol"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"the best experiences in life are free, home in my underwear watching this video"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Wow, all that wealth and she can't even afford a pair of shoes that fit. LOL"
T18b3nG9Vfo,I know what you're thinking about...
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Why am I here, I'm not even rich ;("
T18b3nG9Vfo,She lived in hk for 25 years and failed to acknowledge Hong Kong actor Michael Wong. What a fail of a reporter.
T18b3nG9Vfo,There is a lot of poverty in H K.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"1:51 My god..look at these eyes.. they scream: ""I hunt the homeless for sport"""
T18b3nG9Vfo,“No money no talk” I hear it all the time growing up back home in HK. I live in California over 23 years now never heard this word again.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"""I have lived in Hong Kong for 25 years and I have never seen a city like that"" "
T18b3nG9Vfo,Maybe you can travel a bit...
T18b3nG9Vfo,6:25 what a great deal that it includes other things for 160k.
T18b3nG9Vfo,you guys should make a 2019 version
T18b3nG9Vfo,how tourists travel in hong kong: they don't
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Alternative title: ""Ways you could never travel in HongKong"""
T18b3nG9Vfo,Them eyebrows
T18b3nG9Vfo,13.30 It will worth every penny for just looking at this bartender's eyebrow.
T18b3nG9Vfo,5:50 the girl kinda sounds like a female Donald Trump :/
T18b3nG9Vfo,I just cancelled my trip due to the gang violence. I was really looking forward to return but those gangs with sticks beating up people in the subway and escalators was horrific.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Some day in the near future, you might be able to step on to the moon directly from atop the terraces of these tall buildings. How is that for an experience?!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I have been to HK many times during my career, now that I am retired you can't pay me enough to live there!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,Love these shows so inspiring
T18b3nG9Vfo,"This video is hard to watch, when I know how F up the living conditions for average citizens"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"""no menu, to get a drink you'll have to describe your favourite things to the bartenders"" that's already how I order drinks because I'm oblivious hahaha"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"The rich adores the rich! May this upheaval motion lasts and make all of you bankrupt, crumble and flee from HK."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Can't have a drink from a guy with 1 eyebrow
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Hey....thats the room from Jay Chou's MV ""Give Me Time Of A Song""!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"""If you can afford it, that is..."""
T18b3nG9Vfo,Filipino nannies would come to HK just to clean these expensive properties.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Hong Kong's skyline is bigger and better than NYCs skyline
T18b3nG9Vfo,Experiences that money can't buy? Then why would their be a figure on it???
T18b3nG9Vfo,I'll see it in the next life...after my first millennium of lives.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I went to tim ho wan! Wooo it was great, first michelin starred dim sum i´ve ever had."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Haha, nice to see Michael Wong flying a chopper!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,Not just the dark knight I think inception also had footage from that helipad
T18b3nG9Vfo,This was a very badly presented video in my eyes
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Been in Hongkong for a short vacation trip. I would say, the choices to spend money is very limited. Not many places to go, not many tourism area. Indonesia is much much better choice."
T18b3nG9Vfo,this is a rich person programme
T18b3nG9Vfo,2:22 Am I the only one who read it as PENISula the first time?
T18b3nG9Vfo,Thanks for sharing! You're so gifted. I love to travel as well:)I recently shared my first ever movie - My travel diary in Queenstown. Eep!Would enjoy your advice on my video/editing and so I can also develop like you!
T18b3nG9Vfo,The host is gorgeous
T18b3nG9Vfo,Once I fell on the buses and everyone looked at me and I cryed
T18b3nG9Vfo,wow this is incredible!
T18b3nG9Vfo,That helicopter pilot is a TVB actor!! OMG thought I recognised him
T18b3nG9Vfo,Did you just use the INCEPTION background music?
T18b3nG9Vfo,I’d be happy just to talk with a person interested in various aspects of life
T18b3nG9Vfo,This whole video sounds like my life.
T18b3nG9Vfo,When I'm dreaming
T18b3nG9Vfo,Did she said 15 thousands per night us dollars?? ?
T18b3nG9Vfo,This has hardly anything to do with traveling around HK
T18b3nG9Vfo,CNBC International TV + thank you very much for making this video clip
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I know yall broke ass here. Yeah,me too. Now lets laughing together."
T18b3nG9Vfo,My childhood home and school have disappeared. Hong Kong inspires us to excel. Rewards exist . Do you share?
T18b3nG9Vfo,Just watched the video after watching a documentary on the poor and their small living spaces and high rental prices. Saddening
T18b3nG9Vfo,2:55 all the way till 4:00 look like some porn scene about to start
T18b3nG9Vfo,That’s definitely no “super yacht” lol
T18b3nG9Vfo,awesome City.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I like Hong Kong, not that I can afford those luxuries."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Sin city!
T18b3nG9Vfo,Wow!
T18b3nG9Vfo,I stayed in the intercontinental Hong Kong .... think this video is outdated. New luxury in Hong Kong is rosewood
T18b3nG9Vfo,... Money can buy experience too but I'm actually happy that I dont live like that. Being middle class is where all the fun is at
T18b3nG9Vfo,Welcome to My LIFE
T18b3nG9Vfo,Emily cute
T18b3nG9Vfo,that's why it's hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of GOD......
T18b3nG9Vfo,Crazy Rich Asian
T18b3nG9Vfo,i enjoyed the video but i'm not sure i could eat the food  being offered there
T18b3nG9Vfo,this video needs a reality check
T18b3nG9Vfo,And I thought Singapore was like Hong Kong...
T18b3nG9Vfo,is that Michael Wong in 3:20 ??
T18b3nG9Vfo,10:50 I think that's for the Illuminati ;)
T18b3nG9Vfo,Inside Hong Kong caged houses
T18b3nG9Vfo,Citys ultra wealthy is mostly built on the slaving bone breaking mortgage of homeowner
T18b3nG9Vfo,"This video is a hot mess, what cultural experience is here?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,Compare this with cubicle dream is extremely opposite. Lol
T18b3nG9Vfo,"As a hong konger, none of this in the video interested me."
T18b3nG9Vfo,The princeling billionaires love Hong Kong. It's their playpen.
T18b3nG9Vfo,That hotel has to have an elevator to take me to heaven and back to be worth that price per night
T18b3nG9Vfo,A house built for selfish people. The same amount of sq ft of space would be more precious to some families in need rather than just a few selfish greedy people. F the elites.
T18b3nG9Vfo,How do you know he was the best pilot ever? How many pilots have you worked with?
T18b3nG9Vfo,"How did you find a clear, non-polluted and sunny day?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,You lost me at the shitty pun 1:36
T18b3nG9Vfo,0:18 What is that guy doing by the door??
T18b3nG9Vfo,Hong Kong
T18b3nG9Vfo,I didn't know Liev Schreiber sells yachs.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Sounds so crass. They don't seem to care about quality, just ""the most expensive."" Idiots."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Lol, Mexican flag at 1:21."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Might this be Salinas or Slim?
T18b3nG9Vfo,Nice 14 minutes ads
T18b3nG9Vfo,Is the helicopter pilot one of the actor of TVB / Hong Kong movies?
T18b3nG9Vfo,It's sad how Hong Kong has so much space for luxuries but can't even give enough housing units to others.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Woah. Didn't care much for the real estate but the exclusive food and dinning has me sold
T18b3nG9Vfo,The experiences that only money can buy...
T18b3nG9Vfo,Seize
T18b3nG9Vfo,This is a good video.
T18b3nG9Vfo,go take a look at those subdivided flats
T18b3nG9Vfo,I normally feel inspired by these videos but this was just disgusting
T18b3nG9Vfo,You can have all of hong kong.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"FYI 1 knot = 1,85 kph"
T18b3nG9Vfo,Yeah i will just buy a pizza and a beer and watch a movie with my gf and dog. Simple fun relaxing only like 20 bucks hahahha???
T18b3nG9Vfo,The fact that such pricing exists also reflects that people pay for such things.
T18b3nG9Vfo,tigerrr benson looks like lost couple inch around her bust! but she still give good head!
T18b3nG9Vfo,"100hkd to eat oreos, anyone?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,The narrator sounds so cocky

T18b3nG9Vfo,Most HongKong are poor. The poor ones went to UK in 80's and 90's to start a life there. The wealthy ones send their kids to top UK and US universities.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Isnt the helicopter pilot like an actor??
T18b3nG9Vfo,"""In Chinese, Hong Kong literally translates to..."" WHICH CHINESE???? I didn't know American, or British, or Indian were languages. Why did I not take those classes in school?"

T18b3nG9Vfo,"While on the other end of HK, 41 million are in poverty"
T18b3nG9Vfo,But Hong Kong is Hong Kong no place like Hong Kong. It is a better version of Dubai nature and concrete hand in hand. Where Dubai is concrete and possible war.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"But the claimed 7000 sq feet is not the real usable area , its only about 70  %  ."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Dim Sum the food for emperors? You must be joking. Dim Sum was strictly a low-class civilian food in Guangdong which I bet the Chinese emperor never heard of. When Hong Kong was under colonial rule, the British even showed disdain for such food, and only learned about its goodness closing to 1997."
T18b3nG9Vfo,That Asia pilot has a very sexy voice.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Only suckers eat dim sum at expensive places. the best dim sum can be found only on the local streets where foreigners are afraid to go lol
T18b3nG9Vfo,"You need such big rooms there, because being there in summer is a torture. Forget to go out. You only can stay inside with a good air condition.

T18b3nG9Vfo,"Hong Kong = stupid money!  I've been to three different bars in one night, and paid three different prices (50-100 HK$) for the same brand of whiskey.  People wait in line for mediocre food just to be ""hip"" to whatever the latest online trend is being hawked by some K-pop celeb, who probably never even ate at the place. The only reason real estate is so expensive, is because the gov't keeps the price high by limiting the amount of housing stock. Meanwhile young women from the Phillippines, Malaysia and Indonesia work there in servitude."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Oh and 3 Michelin star ratings.   Are they bought?   You just have to get to know how the adjudicators are - and HK has plenty of money to buy these.   Some may be deserving of 3 star Michelin, but it should be confused with money buying these.  There are plenty of very good eateries and should not be confused with how expensive the ingredients you use are.  Standard high dining use Fois Gras, Uni from japan, lots of gold leaf - expensive wines ... all built on subjective points of view ... there are some 1 star michelin star restaurants in HK that are better some 3 star ones.   It is all to do with who you know and who to pay (as rumour has it)"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I have been to Hong Kong many times and it’s a bore. The Peninsula has great service, but the amenities only became on par after the make-over renovation. "
T18b3nG9Vfo,The heli roof top check in is a pain to arrange. You have to co-ordinate the time and get paperwork hassle if you wanted to say take it to Macau for excursion then transit back to Chek Lap Kok etc...so you may as well go private flights all the way..
T18b3nG9Vfo,"If you need to get your kicks from spending HK$160.000 a night, you are mentally in really bad shape. From the yacht market in Nice and the yacht harbour at Cannes, I can state with absoulte certainty that most of the wealthy are stark raving idiots who are unhappy, peevish, disappointed all of the time. E.g. what do you want with a sip of the most expensive brandy in the world if nobody knows that you are sipping it? These are all bodily experiences which is many notches below what is possible to enjoy on a spiritual level. "
T18b3nG9Vfo,I really don’t get most of those locations. If you are loaded and have working brain cells you know that most of this is a total waste of money
T18b3nG9Vfo,"it can't be that much fun,, remember it's  communist"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"CNBC, shame on you for indulging Marie Antoinette. Living in government subsidized housing is for the poor in the US. About half of HK’s population lives in government housing, that’s if they are lucky enough to be assigned one."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Born Hong Kong 1936, in mainland during WW2, Finished middle school and came to New York as a waiter, graduated from school architecture at Pratt in 1963 and had an around the world honeymoon trip in 90 days with my Hong Kong bride we met in college. Divorced in 1984 and vacation alone in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in 1989. had dinner in the ballroom of Pennisula Hotel with a live band but had no partner.Well, do I miss Hong Kong ? Very much !

T18b3nG9Vfo,Exploiting the poorest citizens and amassing mega wealth! Capitalism at it's finest. A sad decrepit life!
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I would like the Bespoke experience of an eco lodge that is built incredibly cleverly on a mountain where it does not impact on any animal at all, where I can view Brown Bears in the wild, Not Pandas! and then I would like the experience of helping hands on getting the brown bears out of the bear bile farms and helping them in the sanctuary that is run by these very rich Asians (and not run by some white woman from the west)"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"????,tg??????????????????“first class”,??????"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Nothing bad for being Rich. But this inequality is tragic state of affairs. One gets a five bedroom for 15000$ for the night , the other is caged in a fence bin hardly making a dollar a day. Still we allow ourselves to be exploited and ruind by a handful of sly rots."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"At 4:54, I had the exact view of the water in Hong Kong when I stayed in Holiday Inn Harbor View when I vacation there in 1989. I only paid $260 a night, not $15,000 here. George Wu, ARCHITECT, A.I.A., NCARB 2019-2-14"
T18b3nG9Vfo,looks boring
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Does anybody in Hong Kong actually do anything of value, or is it just unnecessary stuff like hedge funds, insurance and financial industries?  It seems to me that networks with an altruistic element can give you less expensive stuff but much higher value.  It's a wonder why nobody in the world appreciates or aims for networking with a certain healthy amount of altruism,  everyone seems to be brainwashed into 100% selfishness, 0% altruism.  The more we go in that direction, the more unnecessary stuff and the less value we seem to get.   All of these tight ass financial suits spend their lives trying to make up for their physical ugliness with money, and they never manage to do it.  I wonder if any of them actually know what it's like to be an honest person and actually have a relationship with the world where people can trust one another without money and contracts being involved."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Very well documented.  Many people don't know Hong Kong famous dim sum is actually the old emperor's cuisine.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Why don't they invest 80% of what they earn & spend it on building new homes for low income communities living it cramped cubicle homes? Ugh, money hungry people!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,crowded and cramped is true picture the rest is a lie
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Someone commented that good dimsum is at the cheap places ! Which I agree because I went to shum sui poh, and I and my family went there twice to a same shop for breakfast,  all of us were satisfied!  To add on.....best Cheong fun is in Hennessy Road in Wan Chai! The shop is call Zhong Kei. I love hk, though it's small , but very vibrant and I love the scenery while hopping island on a ferry! And new territory are many mountains and hills with apartments nearby!  Go to Mah On Shan to view the bful seaside while walking on jogging trail that km's long!!! Finally year end it weather is bful not too cold! If you gave me a choice between New York or HK, I prefer HK! Yes! Property $$$$ is insane! I agree! Probably I grown up with HK movies , and I like their food, and culture! Though there are some rude people but I had meet people I never meet in my place on courtesy ! Last but not least it's SAFE !!!  Btw! I am from Malaysia."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"for those who doesn't know, not like the white woman said in the video.  most of the  Hong Kong people we DON'T celebrate the hand over to China, we see it as tragic to be ruled by totalitarian."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"why Americans are everywhere? where there is money there is Americans, running around with their pockets full. Nothing like money which makes them happy."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Each lifestyle must be depend on our income of coarse!!! Hongkong is one of the famous tourist destination. Best foods and sightseeing!!! There lots decent/ comfy affordable Hotels too!!!
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Only the newly rich fall for this nonsense.  ... Especially sickening to see this excess in a city that makes little provision for the poor and elderly, apart from rent-a-cage housing."
T18b3nG9Vfo,The ultra wealthy took the metro like myself. This is why I am super wealthy !
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Not sure why some people find these expenditures ""disgusting."" These wealthy people, who already have beneficial capital investments in various industries, are literally creating tens-of-thousands of jobs in their drive to live very well (in a hedonistic sense, since financially poor people can live very well in other ways, too)."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Rich people are more isolative.
T18b3nG9Vfo,I thought they would show helicopters
T18b3nG9Vfo,Riches is useless if your character is bad. you will not inherit the kingdom in heaven

T18b3nG9Vfo,Why are all the employees not Chinese? There something wrong with HK is they employ all non-chinese people at top positions. No wonder all the HK Chinese cannot afford a home because they cant get top jobs.
T18b3nG9Vfo,hopeless land
T18b3nG9Vfo,HK is the home for super rich and extreme poor? And USA isn't? It's strange USA documentary only show the differences in other countries but they never borther to show what is actually happening in USA. I suppose it is a way USA try to encourage the separatists and create and plant unrest in other countries but not in her own ground.

T18b3nG9Vfo,Can the super rich avoid the toxics air?
T18b3nG9Vfo,Michelin star is the biggest bull. It caters only to western taste. I can go to  a family run hole in the wall ASIAN restaurant and its super tasty. But since it doesnt have a fancy bathroom and waiter are not white then its not worthy of Michelin Star. What a joke.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"all the important jobs are for white people. after 10 years, hk still disgust me."
T18b3nG9Vfo,where r the good jobs for the asians. for the real hkers. the locals.
T18b3nG9Vfo,10y ago the uni took a trip to the financial sector here. we went to several fancy firms and all the high payin jobs were done by rich white expats. why.
T18b3nG9Vfo,$160k a night for VIP room is not worth it.  You can do so much with that price and even still help a lot of poor people.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I don't mind it as long as they got their riches legally.  They can't take their money with them, when they go.  Let them enjoy the fruits of their labor, just don't put your money under a mattress, make it work for others.  As one Texan millionaire saied, ""Money is like manure, put it in one place and it will smell;  distribute it where it will do some good""."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"That's a cult of money. Taking a helicopter trip is totally wasteful. One can see the panoramic view of Victorian Harbor by just ascending to the Victorian Peak, no other view is better. What is missed is that Hong Kong runs a big market for artwork. There are a great deal of private art galleries preserving works that are artistically valuable. It would be an important destination for the rich who has not only the money but also the taste for art."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Jesus is the way to become rich...........
T18b3nG9Vfo,"He said ,""Trust me and all of your needs shall be met."""
T18b3nG9Vfo,Mathew 16
T18b3nG9Vfo,"…25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it."
T18b3nG9Vfo,i dont care how rich you are 
T18b3nG9Vfo,"if you spend 13,000 a night for a room at a hotel"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"i think 160,000 in description is incorrect"
T18b3nG9Vfo,or 12000 dollars for dinner you will quickly become broke
T18b3nG9Vfo,"This is not such a great myopic ... Owning a boat in HK is nearly impossible.   14,000 boats registered with only 4,000 berths.  So if you buy a super yacht.  Good luck finding a berth.   The likelihood is that it would need to be moored either in Kai Tak, which is heavily polluted and at your own risk - or illegally.   There are only litterally a handfull (counting fingers) of yacht suppliers - Then try find a crew or a captain - that's a pretty rare breed too.  So this life style is for the very few ... Owning stuff is not what HK money is about - it is all about access to the stuff shown here.  The wealth culture is more about pay to use rather than own.   "
T18b3nG9Vfo,They are going to travel first class right into Hell as the bible declares.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Who got their kid to narrate this. How annoying.
T18b3nG9Vfo,My family are narcos and would like to book for 10 days  160.000 totally a bargain
T18b3nG9Vfo,Watching this video makes me realized that Middle East is still the best  place  to live and work and I Vote UAE . Working   Here for 14years and  it’s best way to help my Family back home my country is My beloved Philippines.
T18b3nG9Vfo,You people are sick you made your money through corruption...... the more people you make poor the more people poor will hunt you down for justice
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Whoever this commentator is, is terrible. She sounds like she's going for a fight and not telling  a story. CNBC, can't you find a better commentator?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I dated a Hong Kong millionaire for a brief period. He owned multiple properties in Kowloon. Our dinner dates can range from $1,000 - $10,000. And when I visit, he would always get me a penthouse for about $5,000 a night and it was nothing for him."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Hong Kong is unbearable.  You couldn’t pay me enough to live there.
T18b3nG9Vfo,mumbai banglore city is much better than hongkong shanghai
T18b3nG9Vfo,"This is a dead boring system..and God less!! Uhmm  not interesting at all very Plastic, empty!! This will eventually  all come down 100%... very rich people  with 0 friends. This is not interesting at all. Go look for the real life. You dead people. That is all you think about.. dead!"
T18b3nG9Vfo,So for 9 years they have had a 3 star Michelin restaurant and over that time haven't improved to the 4 th star yet ? Go to NY to eat at a 5 star restaurant.
T18b3nG9Vfo,They need to get slaughtered and the money spread to the people.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Money doesn't buy class, style or manners. HK is testament to that."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"When I see people discussing wealth and expensiveness, I ask one question. Where's the happiness?"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"I know asian people very well they don't even eat at burger king as its very pricey for them, let alone a bottle of wine for 160k"
T18b3nG9Vfo,I hate the way this reporter talks. MOST of them have this horrible way of talking now. Ugh.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Why can't she talk normally like at 3:00???
T18b3nG9Vfo,"$500,000 rent a month... wow."
T18b3nG9Vfo,"and what of the ultra poor that live in slums and even cages, such a false narrative"
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Hong Kong on the surface looks captivating and interesting with so much to do but the city may have its unpleasant features such as run down alleys, notorious Triad activity, excessive intervention and meddling by Beijing, overly expensive housing, property and products. Just think about it? Is it really that worth it. Is HK that fucking awesome just becoz it has stunning skyscrapers and luxurious stuff for only those filthy rich can afford? The quality of life in the city is detiorating and is not helpful with the excessive influx by Mainlanders who some if not most of them act so uncouth."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Hong Kong are poorest land provider in the world. The smallest and most expensive house in Hong Kong.
T18b3nG9Vfo,China needs to clean out these tycoons and confiscate their wealth and redistribute to ordunary people
T18b3nG9Vfo,26 meters is not a super yacht. it is a toy.
T18b3nG9Vfo,"Many people in hong kong live in horrendous conditions, in tiny cubicles packed within a flat, like caged animals. What a shame."
T18b3nG9Vfo,Einstein invented the bombs for Hiroshima; and the Jews today are eating the frozen fish from Pacific Ocean and Alaska with the nuclear waste from Fukushima.- to hpi28
T18b3nG9Vfo,Having lived in HK for almost 4 years I can tell you that this place is not as it is shown here. You get bored very easily. It's a small Island people! You can't remain in your luxury apartment for 24 hours. You eventually will leave the hotel or house and then traffic and small roads hit you.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Frightening!  I am just a poor American girl that has long enjoyed the front page of the Wall Street Journal. While watching this I kept thinking of the story they did . “Friends don’t let rich friends move to Hong Kong.” The article went on to explain how extremely rich Americans that were moving to Hong Kong and being poisoned by beautiful local Asian women. No surprise they would poison the tea. The family of the poor duped Americans could then not get their body or assets out of China. Not just one or two but many had fallen and the intent of the article was to help educate and curb this trend. Being poor has it’s privileges.
T18b3nG9Vfo,HK is paradise to the corrupt communist chinese gangsters and HK gangs government officials. This city is outlawed.
T18b3nG9Vfo,This is really fake because rich people don't blow their loot like that
T18b3nG9Vfo,We have better here in the U.S.A.
T18b3nG9Vfo,This is truly utterly disgusting and outrageous
T18b3nG9Vfo,Basically all imported european junk.  Even the hotels and apartments are designed by Westerners.  China seems to be completely incapable of producing domestic luxury goods.
T18b3nG9Vfo,Rich people are rich because they are greedy. Just ask them. 
4jjFEPeZkJ0,Chi altro è siciliano?
4jjFEPeZkJ0,Like se sei italiano/a ?
4jjFEPeZkJ0,"Wow  Sicily is SOOOOO underrated !! Thanks for bringing this island in the sun on YT ! I have travelled up and down the Italian peninsula and I have to say that the 3 weeks we decided to spend in Sicilia where the best, the scent, colours and history of this island is nothing short of immense emotional explosion , as the great Goethe wrote ''""To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything."" and he hit on the head ! I have been there 5 times since I first discovered it in 1982, my ventures across Sicily, from Ustica and Marsala to Catania and Taormina, stopping at Alcamo, Segesta, Castelvetrano, Caltanissetta, Agrigento, Messina and Enna not to mention those quaint sleepy towns /villages I also climbed Mount Etna and that was a moving experience , especially the view from up there. Sorry for rambling on  but I cant get enough of Sicilia and it's people and immense rich culture . Cheers"
4jjFEPeZkJ0,"Sono siciliana vi consiglio di andare questa estate a Trapani e nelle isole,  Eolie ?"

rSgkbvxTk_8,Truly blonde??
rSgkbvxTk_8,BLOODY STOLE FROM INDIGENOUS
rSgkbvxTk_8,Never knew Australia has such hidden beauty. I was reluctant to visit there as I was not sure what Australia can offer and i was least interested to visit skyscraper clad cities.
rSgkbvxTk_8,@
rSgkbvxTk_8,"It was an Awesome Trip.. the real deal,, not just a BBC documentary,, Real Travel, Real Life Journey! Enjoyed it so much, From Los Angels, CA Thank You!!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,Congrats mate 38:00

rSgkbvxTk_8,"once a lifetime trip, I like all the amazing locations, showing how diffrent australia is ( something that we didnt knew being in a diffrent part of the world )"
rSgkbvxTk_8,Then again Australia is a huge country so it is more or less expected that it has all of this variation
rSgkbvxTk_8,awesome. Where are you all from and how much did you spend?
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Wow, nice video but they forget to visit Canberra, the capital city of Australia."
rSgkbvxTk_8,Truly outstanding travelogue  - well done mate .
rSgkbvxTk_8,I'm from Pakistan i  fully appreciated because full enjoy
rSgkbvxTk_8,"An excellent adventure presented perfectly, well done on both. Pity you missed the really amazing stuff?. If you had turned to the left at Wyndham, you would have made it to Kullumburu, that place is truly magical."
rSgkbvxTk_8,How long did it take you to do the 35000 km ? 1 year ?

rSgkbvxTk_8,"Wonderful, great job. How much money did you spend on all that?"

Awesome, I'm subscribing and will be watching this video over and over again, thank you for making such a terrific story."
rSgkbvxTk_8,"australia has the best beaches in the world, hands down"
rSgkbvxTk_8,who says money can not buy you happiness.
rSgkbvxTk_8,"at 20:20, water seems to run upwards"
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Australia must of had lots of water at the time , funny how a fornner is telling our story"
rSgkbvxTk_8,I enjoyed very much. Thx

rSgkbvxTk_8,AWESOME MAN

rSgkbvxTk_8,What’s the name of the beach at 11:30?
rSgkbvxTk_8,"How did you deal with water, food,  shower, sleeping, fuel depletion etc? plz really want to know"
rSgkbvxTk_8,Excuse me ; but would you like to post the map on the internet? I tried to copy in the video but it was not good; Greetings from Brazil
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Great beaches and swimming until you get chewed by a shark or stung by box jelly fish tentacles or bitten by a sea snake 100s of time more venomous than land snakes, or instead taken by a salt croc. In the bush your are at risk of being bitten by a King Brown snake or deadly spider."
rSgkbvxTk_8,Ripper of a vid
rSgkbvxTk_8,"This is one of the funniest videos you will ever see. Utterly useless but the very epitome of a ""German holiday"". Can't pronounce Australian names, uses some bizarre vocabulary, has no idea of genuine 4x4 driving - has probably already caused one or two deaths by luring idiots into the most hostile environment imaginable. Enjoy it.....it's priceless!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,Where did u guys get the income to travel for a whole year?
rSgkbvxTk_8,Keep putting out content like this and you will have a travel show soon
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Just a small point - the Maheno did NOT come ashore due to a cyclone, it happened in the month of July and so was due to a winter storm - otherwise nice post!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Great vid, but what happened to the east coast? Just Sydney?? straight to Tasy??  and the bight? missed that too! You may have traveled 30,000K's but you jumped over most of the east coast,  south Oz, Nullarbor.... One of Australia's most often visited  ""the great ocean road"" not even a mention??  I know it's a big place and you cant show everything but wow you missed a big chunk of it!!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,Did that Mitsubishi get stuck in Cloncurry QLD?
rSgkbvxTk_8,I hate noise of birds.. All i love is the musical note produced during honking... ??
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Great video! 4WD is not needed, I did all those tracks (except for the Gibb River road) in my trusty vw kombi called MOO! It's not the vehicle, it's the driver! If I ever get another kombi, I would love to go back and do the Gibb River Road and the Canning stock route. I have pictures! haha!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,great video how long did the trip take
rSgkbvxTk_8,"If you're not being suitably rewarded financially by the Australian Tourist Bureau for making this video, you should be!"
rSgkbvxTk_8,I can't believe that you don't have millions of subscribers yet!!! It was wonderful!!! And you're so crazy (in a good way)!!! How much time have you spent on that trip? (Sorry maybe I missed that information cuz I'm not an English speaker:))
rSgkbvxTk_8,I came for the soundtrack and was severely disappointed.  This is the worst possible music  for this video!!
rSgkbvxTk_8,What a horrible selection. The producers are bedwetters.   Fail.
rSgkbvxTk_8,"Tip: When you climb a tree that tall you must wear a safety harness. The steps on that tree didn't look secure at all - the steps look weak like they're made out of some type of soft material. You're lucky those steps didn't break through pressure or you didn't slip and lose your grip - that would've been disastrous, to say the least! "
-r4ZBVPfjAU,It’s so true Americans expect others to speak their languange. It’s so embarrassing!
-r4ZBVPfjAU,aileen: I've been to 27 countries

-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Very informative, thank you! I made a terrible mistake by buying the plane tickets with a connecting flight over US without realizing i need a transit visa which takes ages to get and is not even guaranteed you will get it. So people who need visas, check the transit visa requirements no matter where you go!"

Using incognito was a huge surprise for me and I never thought about it until I saw this video. Thank you so much for sharing your tips and recommendations. ?"

-r4ZBVPfjAU,What was the thing you had the most trouble with since coming to Japan?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Is Airbnb safe? I've thought about using it but I've heard so many horror stories from people used it.
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Can you do a video on all the countries you have been to and which ones were your favorite?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Hi new subscriber heree. Such a helpful video. Thankyouuu
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Taking a risk is true. I booked an Airbnb and the restroom flooded and there was just dog smell. Fun vacation time.
-r4ZBVPfjAU,It was really helpful..
-r4ZBVPfjAU,OMG Lavi I use Ecosia too! Environment buddies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Usually whey you're traveling abroad you need(it's mandatory)to have a roundtrip ticket and proof of hotel booking or wherever you will be staying at....however what if you're not staying at a hotel or airbnb?? What do you need to do if you are staying with a friend???
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Using Incognito mode for browsing .... That's a insanely genius idea. Being an IT person even I never thought about it. Thanks a ton!!! ????
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Ah, wishing I hadn't already booked my place because that Airbnb credit would have helped. :P Very interesting, informative and makes me more excited for my trip! 7/11 is the best for withdrawing money I have heard. :)"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,such great tips!!!!
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"I loved this video, I learned so many new things that I will surely remember and use in the future! Plus, I really adore your voice, it's so vibrant and soothing; it sounds like music. Much love xx"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Younare awesome
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"THANK YOU for sharing Airbnb!!! I am planning a trip and hotel prices are extremely high during this peak season we must travel in, and the hotels aren't even that nice. I checked out Airbnb and there are some really nice rooms for a fraction of the price as hotels. I have never tried Airbnb before.. great idea!!"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Thank you so much for all your tips! I'm sure, I will use them when I travel the next time^^"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"I learned a lot, thank you! I'm a frustrated traveler and the amount of options out there can be overwhelming. This is like an introduction course for people like me who are just starting to learn the how to's/basics. =)"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"I love sky scanner and also Skiplagged for finding cheap deals! It is absolutely true that these sites track your searches, so definitely search them on a private (incognito), setting. Anyone planning travel for 2018 or have any places to recommend?"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Which currency app are you using? Can you please recommend.
-r4ZBVPfjAU,?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Your travel videos are coming at the perfect time! I planned a really last minute trip to Seoul for 2 weeks from now and all of these videos are getting me in the travelling mood! Also I have to say, journaling using some of the methods you've recommended is partially why I'm travelling in the first place. I wrote down the desire to travel and the urge to take a vacation from work and it's silly, but that's what made me realize that I could actually do it and nothing was stopping me! So thanks for everything, girl!"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Thank you for the great tip. Bank of america has a travel reward credit card where you get a travel points for purchases and no foreign transaction fee. I use it all the time during travel and pay off my balance when back home. That way, minimum cash exchange required :)"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,What does she use to film and edit her videos? :O
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Gosh you make me wanna travel so bad, but I'm really scared. Are these bnbs and hotels safe? I have heard a lot of human tracking stories and I honestly don't know. What do you guys think?"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Gosh you make me wanna travel so bad, but I'm really scared. Are these bnbs and hotels safe? I have heard a lot of human tracking stories and I honestly don't know. What do you guys think?"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I live in New Zealand and I really want to go to America but idk how to book a trip there
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"I’m also a solo traveler. I have travelled to more than 15 countries like Oman, japan, Italy, Dubai etc. and thanks for sharing wonderful tips regarding the booking, budget and many more for a trip."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,thats pretty cheap...woahh
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Truth! 6:22
-r4ZBVPfjAU,thanks for your tip about booking flights. it's always the most difficult thing to figure out flight prices on different days.
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"My tip would be depositing cash from your debit card from local ATMs during your travel.. Even after the service charge, the exchange rate is still pretty good and you can always get smaller bills this way. Also, it makes me nervous to carry so many cash on me, esp. if I'm on a trip longer than a week."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Is it better to find flight incognito or to use an account to get the flight booking rewards?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Pro tip for traveling in Seoul: coming out of subway stations can be several long flights of stairs up, so stay at places close to the exits!"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"I want to use your airbnb link but I already have an account, would I have to create a new one ?"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,This was such an informative video! Thank you!
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Going to Namibia next Summer. I'm afraid the public transport and airbnb tips won't work for that xD
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I saw the video as soon as you posted it and I can not stop thinking about what you've been to in 27 countries!
-r4ZBVPfjAU,What are those countries? have you been in my country? I'm from Dominican Republic!! 
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"My experience while traveling to Thailand, was to exchange money once you arrive in Thailand. The rule of thumb is to bring new $100 bills. You will get a better exchange rate than getting the money from your home bank."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,thanks for this! ?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Queen
-r4ZBVPfjAU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOPWjZdWC_E&t=158s
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Really wonderful tips. I find the Hello Talk and the SkyScanner 'Can't Decide Where' absolutely mind-blowing. So thank you for posting this. It's always lovely and wonderful to watch your videos. The aesthetics are so pleasing and yet so simple. I'm trying to improve my videos bit by bit :D
-r4ZBVPfjAU,hello talk this app is not available in my country
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I cant believe it is only like $200 to fly overseas! for Australia it is around $1000
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I love your voice and your vibe
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I never really search in these websites since I use JetBLue when I travel which is not frequent but there are some destinations that JetBLue doesn't offer from Puerto Rico (my country) so I have to do a connected flight but for example to Tokyo there's no flight unless I take one to NYC  and then get another airline to Japan but for future trips I'll use these website just to have a look on average prices.  .
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Have u visited India
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"it feels like ages ago i stumbled onto your podcast on google music. i'm basically in love at this point, and yep i'm hoping for a trip to japan in a year or two, once i have some money and speak the language better. /blog tldr you're on point don't change, and thanks c:"
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I’m American and don’t expect other countries to know English if I visit them. Stereotype much? ?
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Remember me, Aman Tech Tips."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,#earlysquad
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Very very userful info. May I  kindly ask  you a video about how to make your baggage? or perhaps like how to make the ideal luggage, since you travel so much I guess it helps a lot. Considering  that  in some cases   specially when you travel with  a child, you want to make maximal use of your luggage space but do not know how to avoid useless things or forget important ones.Thanks once more."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"Airbnb is just as clean? Even big hotels can messed up big time, just search ""See Which Hotels Were Caught Not Changing Bedsheets for New Guest"". People or agents that handle these apartments are not professionals."
-r4ZBVPfjAU,Wow I’m so early!!!
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I cant speak Japanese but I wanna go see all the evangelion stuff over in Japan. What’s your advice should I not bother if I don’t speak the language? I’ve only ever travel to country that speak Spanish and I speak that so I don’t know what traveling is like with out speaking the local languages.
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I think booked directly to airline s are cheaper what u think
-r4ZBVPfjAU,I don't actually wish to visit Japan but study there
-r4ZBVPfjAU,do you live in China????
-r4ZBVPfjAU,"""Same gender only"" seems a bit sexist.  If a guy were to say the same thing he would be blasted.  Next thing is to filter by race.  I do however understand why you do it. "
yMPJRe2qTlI,"It's been my dream to go to Japan since I've been a little child, but my family is poor and we could never afford it."
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Now I'm 25 and I've managed to save enough money to finally go to Japan this summer, it's a dream that has come true."

yMPJRe2qTlI,"Incredible video dude. I'm heading to Japan in March with my gf and wanted to capture it, but watching this has almost made me give up on the idea! Spectacular work. About the only thing I'd be able to add would be cherry blossoms haha. But, it's one of those things where I know if I want to really create something epic, I'd have to give up a fair bit of my holiday experience of just enjoying it in person to then instead be thinking about how to get the shots I want, which is particularly a problem with someone else with me. (no doubt I'll be told to hurry along)"
yMPJRe2qTlI,I wanna go to Japan because i want to eat alot of ramen
yMPJRe2qTlI,anyone know where i can get that photography clicking soundbite that starts at 0.04 seconds in? cheers!
yMPJRe2qTlI,?????????????????????????????????????????????????
yMPJRe2qTlI,"ALl for this video. Love it. Don't know why you have to show slaughter wholesale of those poor creatures at Tsukiji. If them, why not slaughtered dolphins and whales too? Is it not possible to make a video without such slaughter, whether it's traditional, accepted or not, it's absolutely ironic and hypocritical that ONE form of slaughter ( Tsukiji) is accepted while another ( Whales from the southern ocean) is not. The fish that are being slaughtered certainly don't care if they're famous or not, so why discriminate? A great video with beautiful cinematography otherwise. Please consider what you're showing at the cost of other things you're not."
yMPJRe2qTlI,Wowww...??
yMPJRe2qTlI,I'm Indian and I love japan ????
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Japan is a land of culture ,  technology,  anime,  polite people I love Japan very much more than anything else  ..???????????????????????????????????????"

(during the 18-20, I'll be going to art school, japanese art, specifically.) Once I arrive to japan, I'll try to get a job as a manga artist, and if all that goes downhill, i'll just live a peaceful life as a starbucks worker in japan, living in a minka."

yMPJRe2qTlI,"As a Japanese who stayed couple years abroad, I think Japan is overrated and underrated time to time. It’s a beautiful and exotic country with flaws, just like other countries. One needs to visit here in order to truly understand this. "
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Nonetheless, the video is great and very well edited!"
yMPJRe2qTlI,"This video is something more than just ""a Japanese travel short film""."

yMPJRe2qTlI,"very beautiful country indeed... but its just too bad though because japanese people are depopulating. why? are they planning on going extinct someday in the future? because really, Japan would not be Japan without its people."
yMPJRe2qTlI,"??????????,????????"
yMPJRe2qTlI,And you are deadly wrong- Japanese don't eat only sushi and octopus..
yMPJRe2qTlI,"711, Family Mart or local supermarkets- Ready meals- chicken, beef a'la hamburgers (similar to Polish/German frikadellen)"
yMPJRe2qTlI,Perfectly fresh.
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Only one life, and I'm born in the wrong  place..."
yMPJRe2qTlI,"excellent, what is Premier Pro? sorry i'm not used to editing software"
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Very good video summarizing Japan, but in my opinion there is one small thing that you missed to capture in this video. The one major reason on why I kept coming back to Japan for more than 5 times... it’s FOOD...OH MY! How can you missed the food footage! ????!?"
yMPJRe2qTlI,Wait what? Only 1 sec of drifting? And 90% of the video is religion? LOL. Ok.

yMPJRe2qTlI,hi
yMPJRe2qTlI,Song please
yMPJRe2qTlI,"You might think Japan is always like that after you see this video. But it's always not like this. This video let you imagin Japan is full of btf culture and all of people respect the culture. But I think no one in younger people in Japan have opportunities to relate with the culture. I'm Japanese high school student. But I've never experienced such a btf cultural events. I just get on a fucking crowded train and go to school and strugling with weird society,   unkind people, and bad education."
yMPJRe2qTlI,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
yMPJRe2qTlI,"Everyone here is saying Japan is beautiful and they want to move there and stuff, but in reality, this is only one side of Japan. The work culture is very strict with long hours and overtime for most typical jobs and the society there is also very judgemental and difficult as well. Please think before you say ""I wanna be Japanese"" , because as the saying goes, the grass is always greener on the other side (or so it seems.)"
yMPJRe2qTlI,This is much better than my india
yMPJRe2qTlI,Despite others Bad Thing about Japan...i mean the suicide rate or the hentai things..its not like other country doesnt have that case  ...In My Opinion Japan is the whole new level of country i feel like they live in the future.. 10 step ahead of any other country...Im really in love with their Culture...what really Surprised me the most was that They let their Kids go to school alone starting from age 4...like dayumm
yMPJRe2qTlI,The music is strangely corporate america and not mystical japan...
yMPJRe2qTlI,"For Muslim, Islam kind of thought can be found in JAPAN way of life ie punctuality, cleanliness, orderly and politeness. I am very happy as I have Japanese blood and Japan is just my second home. Japan is a leading country in Asia."
yMPJRe2qTlI,Wth this is incredible
yMPJRe2qTlI,Unfortunately cats are not shown in the video. Japanese people like cats
yMPJRe2qTlI,Disliking the video just because of this reason

yMPJRe2qTlI,When people worship the the deities they have built by their own hands ! 
KT7KJPagp-I,I bring packets of condom when i travel which i use to collect all the sands and soil from different places for my sand and soil collections.
KT7KJPagp-I,to everyone complaining about how these products are very expensive and such - a very important aspect of minimalism that i have learned is that sometimes it is best to buy a quality item that will last a long time as opposed to a cheaper item that you may have to replace many times!!
KT7KJPagp-I,"Instead of an eye mask, pack a bandanna. I've used mine as an eye mask on the plane, a smog mask in Beijing, a neckerchief in the sun, and of course as an actual bandanna. Plus it rolls up into the size of a travel shampoo and weighs next to nothing."
KT7KJPagp-I,These boys are not on a tight budget. $140 for a passport/credit card holder... seriously?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Why is everyone so hard on them? I agree that the budget is on the high end but they are sharing what works for them, take what works for you and leave the rest behind. Safe travels everyone"
KT7KJPagp-I,"13 mins of product placement ...guys I love your channel, so won't hate on you for doing this ...But maybe a little bit more subtlety next time :)"
KT7KJPagp-I,"On the comment where you said "" you can't afford to be hungover and miss a day "" that happened to me during my trip to London. I had planned to go to the London Bridge but was entirely too hungover to go the next day. That same day the terrorist attack happened on the bridge. I went straight from being bummed about missing a day, to thankful I didn't go, and bummed about the attack. It was really strange honestly. Maybe it saved my life, who knows?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Even when you're in a relationship bring these for someone else.....""    ........ Bros, are you trying to get me killed? o_0"
KT7KJPagp-I,best advice is the pill :D I never knew they're important.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Your video is ok but it's clear you don't really apply the minimalist concept, like at all."
KT7KJPagp-I,OMFG that kelly reference <3
KT7KJPagp-I,shoes. omg. lets get some shoes.
KT7KJPagp-I,"I travel for business, and i totally agree with what these brothers have suggested."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Regarding the prices, all the products mentioned have cheap alternatives that can be found on amazon, all you need to do is find the right one for your needs."
KT7KJPagp-I,I live for these videos! I spent more time planning  what was going in my backpack rather than my actual trip around the world last year. #geek
KT7KJPagp-I,"1:30 they just throw some word in my language like this lol, i didnt expect that !!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"baksheesh: giving someone money to make them ""happily"" do something for you."
KT7KJPagp-I,hashish: weed.
KT7KJPagp-I,I always need my phone ? and laptop ?
KT7KJPagp-I,Google translate on your phone can be useful to
KT7KJPagp-I,"01:37 is it just me or did I hear the word ""Hashish"" which means drugs in Arabic ?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"damn, this was a great list! You guys covered everything and i now i just to buy a ticket to somewhere!"
KT7KJPagp-I,The advice from the first ten seconds has earned a sub from me haha
KT7KJPagp-I,"lol at ""shoes"" that used to be one of my favorite videos :D"
KT7KJPagp-I,Ahhh  the little owl sleeping mask from Estonia made its appearance again ?

KT7KJPagp-I,I would recommend replacing the flip-flops with slides or light weight sandals because you can wear them with socks to keep your feet warm on chilly mornings or evenings indoors.
KT7KJPagp-I,the aspect of minimalism that i enjoy is purchasing (sometimes) expensive items that LAST a year or more!!!!!
KT7KJPagp-I,This is such a great video! I just started my channel and I'm stoked on this.

KT7KJPagp-I,"hi, where's the video of fitting it all on the carry on bag?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Thankyou !!!
KT7KJPagp-I,I think power-bank is also we need to travel
KT7KJPagp-I,Half way through I realized this is their shout out to their sponsors. Minimalist? hmmmm
KT7KJPagp-I,Can I fly internationally with my Katadyn pocket model filter in my carry on?
KT7KJPagp-I,Absolute essential a Tablet to watch Netflix!!?
KT7KJPagp-I,"I think this is so awesome! Love these kind of videos!  :) I look forward to your ""how to pack"" video. You guys are awesome!"
KT7KJPagp-I,If you have a phone then don't worry about a clunky ipad. You can watch netflix etc on your phone too..
KT7KJPagp-I,These shoes rule! These shoes suck! hahaha first video I ever watched on youtube
KT7KJPagp-I,Perfect timing as we plan for our trip to Spain!  Thank you guys :-)
KT7KJPagp-I,Absolute legends! This guide is seriously awesome. As a pretty much full time traveler I can verify this is an awesome guide.
KT7KJPagp-I,I pack MUCH less than the items they recommend.
KT7KJPagp-I,6:57 My mind went directly to Sephen and Damon. HELLO vampire diaries.
KT7KJPagp-I,This info is the real deal...thanks guys!!
KT7KJPagp-I,Hahahaha hashish ??
KT7KJPagp-I,"Great video guys! I'm happy to see that I have almost the same essentials! My tip to never forget anything as an almost full time traveler is to have a basic packing list on my phone, this way I only have to add things that are specific to the destination I'm headed to, and it's much faster to pack!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Compartmentalizing is definitely my favorite thing when traveling. I have about 6 different fabric bags with a zipper. One for flight: USB plug, 3in1 cable for phones, eyemask, toothbrush and earplugs. The Second got camera stuff and third got chargers."
KT7KJPagp-I,"great tips! u should do a video on moving abroad, shipping your stuff and moving with your pet etc. i am moving abroad. i am shipping my car and my stuff via freight. im using a company to take care of flying my cats over to me?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Excellent tips guys! I need an adaptor like that and a rain jacket. I bring always some warm clothes,  even if it's summer time cause climate changes a lot in several places."
KT7KJPagp-I,"For the multi plug its also verry important to know, that in some countrys there are different currents (in us about 110v, in Europe 230v) and not all products will work with it or even get broken when u try it!"
KT7KJPagp-I,Great Video. Thank you for posting.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Love watching your videos, you are such nice guys and a lot of stuff has been helpful to me, keep it up :)"
KT7KJPagp-I,"So it''s okay to bring a razor on carry-on? I'm kind of unclear on this. Thanks for the tips, boys"
KT7KJPagp-I,Great ?
KT7KJPagp-I,But no Google Maps in China??
KT7KJPagp-I,And a lot more apps blocked
KT7KJPagp-I,"I can travel whole europe with budget required for these things. You could simply say ""Hey it's sponsored video but watch it ffs"""
KT7KJPagp-I,Also bring an ATM card?  Wow... who knew that you would need one to draw currency?
KT7KJPagp-I,Love the Chappelle reference in there Alex lol!
KT7KJPagp-I,Marko speaks hindi ?
KT7KJPagp-I,I am soo happy by hearing it?? baksheesh
KT7KJPagp-I,"Nice tips. I’d say it’s funny how well this correlated with backpacking ideology, but they’re essentially the same thing apart from the “environment” you’re in."
KT7KJPagp-I,"You guys are so cute! Me encantan sus vídeos, gracias!"
KT7KJPagp-I,Thank you for including packing tips for us ladies!
KT7KJPagp-I,Here because of Carrie Rad- you guys are great! Love the travel vlogs :)

KT7KJPagp-I,If only I had a handsome travel buddy like you two. ?
KT7KJPagp-I,More hand gestures please.
KT7KJPagp-I,Ugh finally. 99% of the travel / packing videos are done by women for women. Does not apply to me.
KT7KJPagp-I,Thanks guys.
KT7KJPagp-I,Great video. When is your travel style video coming out?
KT7KJPagp-I,Absolutely Love the videos from vagabrothers
KT7KJPagp-I,My tipp dont bring to much with you!
KT7KJPagp-I,Lol tells everyone he carries 100s ?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Hi guys, I can't find your video on the travel style."
KT7KJPagp-I,They’re man jeggings
KT7KJPagp-I,This video is so fun as it is interactive and that's just flipping awesome!
KT7KJPagp-I,This seemed like one long product commercial
KT7KJPagp-I,This guide is awesome! Thanks guys
KT7KJPagp-I,"Great video! I actually do almost all of these already. Here are a few things I was surprised by: 100 dollar bills,  cologne and pills. First, the Benjamins..."
KT7KJPagp-I,"have you ever had a problem with having a bank accepting the bill? In South America, I've had serious challenges with them. Maybe I've had bad luck, but the people/banks there don't have a way to test it, and there are apparently a lot of counterfeits. "
KT7KJPagp-I,- Wear boots on a plane !?!?
KT7KJPagp-I,- Good luck passing some borders with a bottle full of unlabeled pills 
KT7KJPagp-I,- and no ziploc bags ?
KT7KJPagp-I,I laughed at the way they used baksheesh :D . I t literally means wages but they made it sound like a bribe.
KT7KJPagp-I,??Esential Great tips my Bros????
KT7KJPagp-I,I loved this video! Being able to travel full time is my life goal. Do you guys have a video where you talk about how you got started doing that  and how you turned it into your job?
KT7KJPagp-I,Are you guys gonna come back with them t shirts again ?
KT7KJPagp-I,420k subs
KT7KJPagp-I,"Good recommendations on how to limit how much clothing to bring, but i don't think this is quite a minimalist pack."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Thumbs up for ""OMG. Shoes."" Lets get some shoes!"
KT7KJPagp-I,What is the name of the backgound music that starts at 7:02? They always use it on the food porn subcription on snapchat!
KT7KJPagp-I,Great Video! Subscribed. Thanks!
KT7KJPagp-I,This video is a joke :D
KT7KJPagp-I,Great video-informative and very funny-love from Cyprus
KT7KJPagp-I,I love traveling light so I usually pack as little as I can in a small backpack. But sometimes they stop me at the airport and once I was almost denied entry into Canada when taking a bus from Seattle. They said I was suspicious because I didn't have a lot of luggage. WTF! Why would I want to lug around so much shit. I really get annoyed when I get stopped. Anyone else experience this??
KT7KJPagp-I,I went to bali for two weeks with less than that
KT7KJPagp-I,"Glad you're liking the All Conditions Essentials Pocket, great tips!"
KT7KJPagp-I,Ziplock bags!! Keep essentials dry and wet stuff separate!
KT7KJPagp-I,Just found your channel and you gained a new subscriber.
KT7KJPagp-I,Awesome tips bros!!  cheers
KT7KJPagp-I,I thought the charger was handcuffs from the thumbnail...
KT7KJPagp-I,hella stole the format of a hypebeat essential video
KT7KJPagp-I,"Thanks for the video , this is really important to pack what you really need and use in the trip or vacation that you are going for . unless you like to take the whole home with you to the plane and pay for it double , you need to carry it and you need to pay extra because of the weight of it ...."
KT7KJPagp-I,I'm only 12 soooooo
KT7KJPagp-I,I don't need 25% of that ooo and also a girl
KT7KJPagp-I,Like those shirts! Where can I find them?
KT7KJPagp-I,LOVE your wall colour!
KT7KJPagp-I,Life Savers!
KT7KJPagp-I,This is beautiful.
KT7KJPagp-I,"I have never seen so much product promotion in a so-called minimalist video. Separate camera when I've always got my phone? Earphones instead of earbuds? A fancy case just for the cords (and enough electronics with different cords that you might even want such a thing)... Three pairs of footwear??? I think these guys have a very different definition of ""minimalism"" than me..."
KT7KJPagp-I,08:43:00 AM
KT7KJPagp-I,For I mainly go on long flights and I am currently in school so I just work on my essays on flights
KT7KJPagp-I,wow thanks from morocco
KT7KJPagp-I,Good set of headphones? Beats are sub par at best.
KT7KJPagp-I,"""bacsheesh"" means tip...."
KT7KJPagp-I,great watch!!
KT7KJPagp-I,i adore how smart this marko is
KT7KJPagp-I,"Wow you guys are better than this.. I understand the importance of ""selling out"" in some ways you need to make money. BUT you still have to make the content useful. This video was a commercial and literally had nothing to do with the title. "
KT7KJPagp-I,"Sure your clickbate, false title video will give you more outreach. But you have to have substance in the video too, not just all useless commercializing. This is how you peak and lose subscribers..."
KT7KJPagp-I,How do you afford to travel often?
KT7KJPagp-I,I'm going to Taiwan soon (RIP Grandpa ??????) and this video helps a lot. Thank you guys!
KT7KJPagp-I,I feel like this is an advert compilation?
KT7KJPagp-I,Amazing tips . Still waiting on you guys to hit the Dominican Republic !!!
KT7KJPagp-I,"These are tips for ""touristing"", not travelling. Noise cancelling headphones? Ipads, laptops, maps to get from airport to hotel? Hotel? :D vagabrothers, more like ""netflixing around the world""."
KT7KJPagp-I,The song at the end?
KT7KJPagp-I,“Netflix and travel... Pretty chill” lol
KT7KJPagp-I,great video! I realized what the essentials to pack are only after backpacking on my last trip! Hoping to achieve a day where I don't overpack.
KT7KJPagp-I,“Obviously” haha that said that like 100 times lmao
KT7KJPagp-I,"Headphones and tablet to Netflix? A passport organiser and cable taco that are each twice as bulky as their contents? These things are the antithesis of MINIMALIST and ESSENTIALS, the words you emphasise so much. I get the laptop cause blogging is your job. "
KT7KJPagp-I,"Also your stuff is super expensive- any traveller with a lick of sense will tell you the things you're carrying need to be replaceable, because on the road they can and will get damaged, irreversibly stained or lost."
KT7KJPagp-I,You guys were super informative and you made your video very fun I loved it please keep making videos
KT7KJPagp-I,Thank you soo much'
KT7KJPagp-I,Super useful info guys! Great video as always. Me encanta su contenido. Saludos desde Tijuana. Peace!
KT7KJPagp-I,"everyone is complaining about how this is not even close to minimalist, however I'm watching this and thinking ""HOW DO THEY ONLY BRING 3 PAIRS OF UNDERWEAR??!?!""  in literally in awe about how these guys pack so little for such a large trip....omfg ??"
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Brothers"" - haha"
KT7KJPagp-I,Thanks!
KT7KJPagp-I,Now I'm wondering if they tried to eat that burrito. ?
KT7KJPagp-I,Great tips!
KT7KJPagp-I,"3:35 - If your headphones are Bluetooth headphones, there will not be a slot for a cord so not sure what you are saying there ...."
KT7KJPagp-I,First time watch you guys. Super good info and funny. Loved it!!!
KT7KJPagp-I,Good Stuff Guys!!
KT7KJPagp-I,"great video fellas. I will opt for some more budget items, and maybe splurge for a couple things haha. I have a couple trips coming up and want to try and pack lighter than I have in the past...  subbed and notifications on, thanks"
KT7KJPagp-I,Liked your videos. Just subscribed. Keep it up.
KT7KJPagp-I,Yay! Thanks
KT7KJPagp-I,Awesome Video as Always ! Keep it up Guys ! Cheers from Austria <3 !

KT7KJPagp-I,Great Video .......Thanks a lot for sharing these Tips
KT7KJPagp-I,No joke I once packed my track spikes for a beach trip
KT7KJPagp-I,"Lol, the whole video is just them advertising 50 different products to try and make you buy"

KT7KJPagp-I,too long for a youtube video!
KT7KJPagp-I,Cheers Guys... Awesome ? ?

KT7KJPagp-I,"ps. marko you are super handsome, and should think about modeling in your spare time..!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"I’m watching all your videos on tips what and how to pack and what type of traveling backpack to buy. I’ll be traveling to Mexico and Central America later this summer. Thank you both for all the tips, and where to buy many of these products."
KT7KJPagp-I,I just use starling bank tbf
KT7KJPagp-I,very nice job guys :D that was the first time that I saw a video of you guys and it was a really nice surprise!

KT7KJPagp-I,Brothers? or Lovers?

KT7KJPagp-I,"You guys need to make that travel style video.  As a dude, its hard to find ANY videos on youtube about  what to wear."
KT7KJPagp-I,did you get do a video on packing for tropical area?
KT7KJPagp-I,Where’s the link for the adapters??
KT7KJPagp-I,"I go on holiday and take my passport, credit crads, money etc. Is it really needed to make a youtube video for this ?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Do more vlogs!!!!! I enjoy them more than the top 10 lists.
KT7KJPagp-I,A good travel kit bag would comes really handy when traveling
KT7KJPagp-I,That's still over packing.
KT7KJPagp-I,when they were talking about the universal plug i looked at my own one and it is the same one i have
KT7KJPagp-I,haahaha oh so you went to Arab countries XD yeah avoid the hasheesh and always give baksheesh ;) lol XD
KT7KJPagp-I,"Great stuff. I seriously need to upgrade my traveling gadgets, you've got some good ones. I have that exact same universal power adapter though. Same journal too. Curious to see where you guys will be going in the coming year."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Do you have a video from Rome, Italy?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Nice breakdown. What size bag do you travel with?
KT7KJPagp-I,"great video for packing, not really minimalist though."

KT7KJPagp-I,Thanks for that great tips.
KT7KJPagp-I,"dont email it PLS. never sent ID docs over unencrypted media. use free cloud services such as onedrive, dropbox, etc."
KT7KJPagp-I,DIY? where?
KT7KJPagp-I,WTF? How do you dare to call it minimalist to put 50 items on a bag? ¬¬
KT7KJPagp-I,"And still call it ""essentials"""
KT7KJPagp-I,Thanks for the tips! Question - what type of Rains jacket is that? Checked their website but can't seem to find it. I'm really digging it though!
KT7KJPagp-I,this was SO sponsored
KT7KJPagp-I,is there any place that you really want to see but haven't been able to yet?

KT7KJPagp-I,Marko looks like one of the chainsmokers  members
KT7KJPagp-I,2:32 that's all Luke wanted
KT7KJPagp-I,"Thanks for your video guys. I agree that some of the stuff may be a bit pricy (judging by the comments) but the truth is you could choose a version of these products to suit your budget anyway. And it does seem pretty minimalist to me, especially if you film professionally and take long flights. Good video, thanks :)"
KT7KJPagp-I,in love
KT7KJPagp-I,"Useful tips! Reminding of passport is not so obvious, particularly if somebody is a  EU citizen just like me  and can travel to many destinations without it."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Very useful video, but you forgot vaccinations. You do not want to get rabies."
KT7KJPagp-I,Which camera gear you use for vlog
KT7KJPagp-I,"I was like passport really ?!?! Then he said ""baqsheesh"" and I went; ok I can relate to this .. and I didn't know google maps works offline .. that was useful ??"
KT7KJPagp-I,a magnum?
KT7KJPagp-I,there si no description how to get American passport... :)
KT7KJPagp-I,"I only have 2 shoes, one for my left foot and one for my right foot, nothing else, I wear them until they start to look like the discarded rubber from tires on roads."
KT7KJPagp-I,Jansport Burrito ? I need one now
KT7KJPagp-I,What's a grocery bag?
KT7KJPagp-I,So I went to India 3 years back and we went in the nice weather when it was 80°-90° daily and so where I live it was 14° and snowy since we went In February but anywho we didn't bring a jacket because psh who needs em in that weather well we didn't think until when we were flying back home and we saw snow on the ground and it was -14° yeah so even if you aren't going somewhere that needs it bring it for an occasion like this
KT7KJPagp-I,Awesome video. Where did you guys get your big map?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Still, what would you put in your minimalist first aid kit? I'd really like to know. Thanks!"
KT7KJPagp-I,I don't even have some of these things at home :/
KT7KJPagp-I,they’re so hot.
KT7KJPagp-I,BTW what size backpack do ya suggest getting if im trying to travel with a carryon and backpack.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Awesome, in-depth video but all this stuff is so expensive. I need to sell a couple organs just to afford all this. I thought traveling minimally was suppose to be cheap -_-"
KT7KJPagp-I,Can you get an anker powerbank in walmart or target? Please reply if you know if they have
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Here Maps"" is much better, because you can download whole states, countries and continents forever and not like google maps just for a limited time and area"
KT7KJPagp-I,Do you have a link to the little tripod attached your Sony camera? 04:17
KT7KJPagp-I,Thanks
KT7KJPagp-I,For the vitamin pills do you need to  inform the airline about it before the flight? Or just bring it and tell them its vitamin?
KT7KJPagp-I,Nice video guys!
KT7KJPagp-I,You two are plebs... can't surf YouTube about travel without bumping into self-important twits.
KT7KJPagp-I,Can you bring a razor as carry on?
KT7KJPagp-I,"minimalist, eh?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Marko, what's your favorite journal/notebook and pen to use when writing on the road?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Huh no one ever asks me for condoms.
KT7KJPagp-I,"All these complaints about ""how expensive"" these items are were written in the back of coach in a middle seat...  Calm down people."
KT7KJPagp-I,sun screen?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Lush has travel-friendly toiletries like solid perfumes, bar soaps for all purposes, and tins to keep it all in. Decently cheap as well."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Toilet paper, ear plugs, panadol, tums done"
KT7KJPagp-I,these are obvious and also so much product placement
KT7KJPagp-I,11:31:00 AM
KT7KJPagp-I,By far the most important advice for traveling. 
KT7KJPagp-I,Getting sick will ruin your vacation people..!!!
KT7KJPagp-I,That comment about bakshish.... are you buying sex?
KT7KJPagp-I,A) No one must buy it.
KT7KJPagp-I,B) Many sellers have been trafficked.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Love your packing list guys! Can't wait for the next videos.. My question is: if you guys only take carry on baggage, how do you keep the weight under 7kg/15lb? (That's the international baggage limit from Australia)"
KT7KJPagp-I,Loved this video.
KT7KJPagp-I,I'm new to credit cards. I do not own one. Why is it an essential for travelling?
KT7KJPagp-I,I would like to become full time traveler one day. My question is how do you make money with traveling other than youtube?
KT7KJPagp-I,My shoe size is 13... I just pack inside them
KT7KJPagp-I,You can use Bluetooth on a plane
KT7KJPagp-I,yelawolf is in tha house or what? haha
KT7KJPagp-I,"you're kidding, ESSENTIALS ??? :D"
KT7KJPagp-I,Put your essential in airtight see through travel kits to make them accessible and easy to see when you unpack. My favorite travel kits are from Roadeavour.
KT7KJPagp-I,Sleeping bag...?
KT7KJPagp-I,tyyyy!
KT7KJPagp-I,What brand of power converter is that?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Can you make a video that suggests the same stuff, but have it not make you go bankrupt...?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Where can I get a red button down like that? Looks good!
KT7KJPagp-I,"Nix the $100's... Alot of places won't accept them, I'd caution atleast $50's but even that isn't super flexible."
KT7KJPagp-I,are nail clippers allowed in. carry ons?
KT7KJPagp-I,bring condom for you friends X) your girlfriend actually fell for that?
KT7KJPagp-I,"ew, beats"
KT7KJPagp-I,"When I travel I usually only bring two pairs of shoes, sneakers and crocs. I don't own boots and I don't really have a purpose for them. Although, if I do plan on going out somewhere I'd also bring a pair of heels."
KT7KJPagp-I,"I keep a cheap Victorinox Waiter tool in my toiletries kit.  It has a corkscrew for those European wine bottles, and knife for my salami and cheese and panini snack in the hotel room."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Guys, too commercial!"
KT7KJPagp-I,global degree ?
KT7KJPagp-I,I’m not sure about the vitamin B part where it prevents mosquitos
KT7KJPagp-I,"I would love a video that touches on all the different types of power adaptors.  The really small ones do not seem to have the adaptor for countries like Argentina.  Also, cell phone specifics.  How to switch to local SIM card, vs paying International fees and how this differs country to country and provider to provider."
KT7KJPagp-I,"awesome video!!! my tip: many backpackers (nature types, not travel types) don't use boots anymore while on the trail. They are extra heavy and causes tons of fatigue. That being said, ill never wear boots again, if at all possible. sturdy athletic shoes ftw!"
KT7KJPagp-I,I thought the guy with long hair seems act likes a woman??
KT7KJPagp-I,Travel Journal ?
KT7KJPagp-I,oh god that shoes video!  suddenly its 2007 and im back in college
KT7KJPagp-I,"that ""baksheesh and hasheesh"" part !!????"
KT7KJPagp-I,What about the Grey Poupon?
KT7KJPagp-I,This sort of travel is a travel without adventure for sure
KT7KJPagp-I,Please Russian subtitles! I am deaf.
KT7KJPagp-I,awesome guid thanx 4 tips guys.
KT7KJPagp-I,bakshish you learnt that word in varanasi?

KT7KJPagp-I,"Great video, really useful."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Hi Alex and Marko! I don't know if you already mentioned this, but can you do your recommendation on good and durable winter jackets? Cheers :)"
KT7KJPagp-I,Wine and club soda are mouthwash and detergent-a must have?
KT7KJPagp-I,1000th comment

KT7KJPagp-I,this video is sponsored by Walmart where shopping is a pleasure
KT7KJPagp-I,This video was pretty good! I'll consider what you guys have said for my trip to Wales next Spring.

KT7KJPagp-I,"Things i learned from my travels : carry a strong lock for the hostels, a bit of tiger balm for weird odors in planes/trains/hostels and relieving headaches, carry your toileteries in a clear ziplock bag so you can go through TSA without digging through your bag and having everyone hating you, carry more ziplock bags in case something spill/you need to separate laundry or a wet swim suit/bring back rocks or sand ! Also those moleskin tapes will save your feet when you do a lot of walking"

KT7KJPagp-I,"I once bought an anal plug from Amazon with built-in wifi. Unfortunately, it wasn't waterproof as promised and therefore caused very unpleased electro shocks. However, after a few days, I got used to it and now even enjoy the tingling sensation. Overall it was a great purchase!"

KT7KJPagp-I,What is good noise reduction ear phone would you suggest?
KT7KJPagp-I,This is like expensive travelling
KT7KJPagp-I,"Typically the credit card companies already know when/where you are traveling due to their algorithms. Even the company whose card you didn't use to book the airline/hotel tickets will know for this same reason. Call them anyway for peace of mind, but mostly--call your BANK FOR YOUR ATM card to continue working. Don't leave your atm card at home because even if you bring a set amount of money, you WILL need more. We ran into this problem in Rome and tried using our credit card in an atm for a cash advance and we got locked out because we didn't have a 4-digit security code set up. So do that, too."
KT7KJPagp-I,Nice guys. But I can never travel with only carry on because I have so much tech with me he he
KT7KJPagp-I,how do you pack a razor with TSA regulations if you are just bringing a carry-on backpack?
KT7KJPagp-I,Best joke : You can not eat it. People have triede

I'd like to be ready for several years of backpacking around the world, sleeping in my tent often as opposed to staying in hostels and such."
KT7KJPagp-I,Also pack a small first aid kit.
KT7KJPagp-I,"I highly recommend Vitamin C.  I take my normal dosage of 2000IUs/day, and then pack anywhere from 1000-3000IUs extra for a few days before going back home, as well as increasing the dosage by atleast 1000IUs for about a week before I get on the plane.  Vitamin C is highly effective to ward off colds, flus, etc.  It is nontoxic as whatever your body doesn't need, it excretes.  Vitamin C is antimicrobial, antifungal, and just all around great for keeping you health."

KT7KJPagp-I,"I think you guys had some great travel tips! A gem for any traveler that wants to get away from the hotel/motel scene is Airbnb.  I've had some pretty great experiences with Airbnb over the last couple years. You can set your price range and experience type (I prefer renting an entire home for a weekend) and explore your options in cities around the world. Here is a referral link for some $ off your first stay! Stay curious my friends, and explore as much as you can! "
KT7KJPagp-I,Excellent advice re downloading google maps before you go. You should be using an RFID shielded passport wallet to protect passports and credit cards with chips from being scanned. Exofficio underwear are great - no more than 2 pairs. 4 pairs of socks is too many and there are lighter noise-cancelling headphones if you must have them! 1 jacket is spot on:)

KT7KJPagp-I,"We have been traveling with our two kids now for three years and we have yet to master this. There are too many debates on what is needed or not, so we compromise on over packing. We love our travel life and would not trade it for the world."
KT7KJPagp-I,"minimalist in the title is a click bait, this is packing for backpacking or fashion show?"
KT7KJPagp-I,you did not specify the reason for the need a smartphone. I did all my travelling so far with the help of a map and my compass so I dont see why that kind of newfangled bits and bobs should be useful.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Do you think that an action camera may be OK for travel videos? I want to get a camera, but I think that I could save a lot of money going with a GoPro hero 5 vs a real camera like a sony a6300"
KT7KJPagp-I,Do you ever get flack for the random giant jar of pills or no?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Except for clothing (which even then isn't much more), I was surprised I actually do pack as minimalisticly as most of these suggestions."
KT7KJPagp-I,suuuunscreeeeen
KT7KJPagp-I,"I know I'm a bit late to the party on this one, but I've got an iphone case that's also a battery pack.  It gives me another 1.5X the battery life.  It make the phone a little thicker but it's better than carrying an extra battery pack or charging cord with you when your out and about.  Instead, when your battery is low, you just power up with a button on the back and it starts to charge.  It's saved me many times when I've been out for long days.  BTW, thanks for all the great videos they've helped me a ton with my plans to Ireland."
KT7KJPagp-I,What about shorts?
KT7KJPagp-I,Its funny when he says: Ollo clip its pretty cheap...
KT7KJPagp-I,"So many ads. Very few stated here are essential, but it's good to provide u with ideas."

KT7KJPagp-I,Do you guys still travel with only carry on if you're gone for like 6months to a year?
KT7KJPagp-I,Cute guys!
KT7KJPagp-I,"I'm traveling the Pacific Northwest right now and I've packed almost exactly like you would. Except more warm things - I like to be able to mix and match fleece, rain jacket, light cardigan and parka depending on whether it's rainy, ice stormy, snowstormy, or just plain chilly, all of which I've experienced in the past three weeks. The parka is always on during travel so it never takes up bag space. ?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Guys, do you think I will be OK with this list if I am leaving on Monday for Colombia and doing 6 months all the way around South America and I will not be in Southern Argentina and other places that have opposite seasons as us until around May/June, so I am afraid that it will be super cold in the Andes, etc."
KT7KJPagp-I,this was just like a commercial
KT7KJPagp-I,"Instead of buying travel size toiletry kits buy reusable 100 ml bottle kits, waaaaay better for the environment and your wallet. Also, if the content is solid, carry the full size version (the deodorant for example). Stay away from unnecessary plastic when possible!"
KT7KJPagp-I,minimalist.... a person who wants  to keep things very simple.....  
KT7KJPagp-I,this video....
KT7KJPagp-I,Here goes a purely positive comment:
KT7KJPagp-I,"I admire how you just enjoy what you are doing, how you just live your days by one and also launch this very high quality content. Thumbs up for those, who are cool enough to be sponsered for travelling, use all the opportunities you get!(:"

KT7KJPagp-I,They say when you take condoms in the trip you'll never have sex and vice versa - if you didn't take condoms there will be moments when you'll need it :D
KT7KJPagp-I,1. SeaToSummit XL UltraLight FastDry Travel Towel. It works as a neck warmer.
KT7KJPagp-I,2. Mini Soap Bars
KT7KJPagp-I,"Literally checked the description before the video even started & instantly disliked. Clickbait, misleading video that's confirmed by the multiple comments calling you guys out. Disgusting."
KT7KJPagp-I,Does anyone know where you can get the digital burrito if you live in Europe (Sweden). The website in the description box doesn't ship to Europe and I cannot find it anywhere
KT7KJPagp-I,"Interesting tip about the vitamin b and mosquitos!  Is it a specific type of vitamin b?  Also, am curious about what you guys think about the whole zika thing.  Trying to decide on a beach honeymoon destination (with clear water) and it's making it a little difficult bc we would like to start trying to have kids right away and is a worry for us."
KT7KJPagp-I,I'll probably never leave this country. Why am I watching this?
KT7KJPagp-I,https://mytravelkarma.wordpress.com
KT7KJPagp-I,Most of you enjoy these great videos for free. Why shouldn’t they make a little bit of money from product placement?

KT7KJPagp-I,Moo
KT7KJPagp-I,"That's an adapter, not a converter."
KT7KJPagp-I,Not minimalist on the budget!
KT7KJPagp-I,I pressed like for the hash joke
KT7KJPagp-I,Good video guys. I can't help think this was sponsored by the products you're advertising.
KT7KJPagp-I,+Tony Chan thanks Tony but just so you know this video IS NOT sponsored and when we do sponsored content we are straightforward and transparent. These are the actual products we use and bring when we travel to make films
KT7KJPagp-I,no one uses mini usb ffs.. this video is not well researched and definitely neither minimalist nor essentials.. but hey. go with the flow.
KT7KJPagp-I,guy on right is trying too hard to make corny jokes
KT7KJPagp-I,Wish we could be this minimalist!  Traveling for a year and we are still trying to reduce what we are carrying around.  These are all good tips.  I had an issue with my bank and had to have someone back in the states go into the bank branch to fix it!

KT7KJPagp-I,What about the bag to put it all in?
KT7KJPagp-I,"very minimalistic and DIY! wow, what a waste of time"
KT7KJPagp-I,any ideas on how to pack minimal but for 7 months? Ive got a season job abroad and i have no idea what essentials ill need
KT7KJPagp-I,"These boys seem to travel with lots of stuff. Great tips, but i don't think 'minimalist'. You don't always need this much stuff. Otherwise some really good ideas. I like ideas for things you can use for multiple uses."

KT7KJPagp-I,"I loved the idea of the Ollo clip, but the price of it was enough to cover about half of my total hostel costs for my entire trip. So. I went onto Amazon, and found a similar gadget for about 12 bucks. Still, I never would've thought to get it without having seen this video. Thank you guys!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"If u bring medicine, bring the label!!! The people checking u at airports may think its some kind of drug."

KT7KJPagp-I,Minimalist lol
KT7KJPagp-I,im not sure if your 11 you need a comdom
KT7KJPagp-I,?????
KT7KJPagp-I,Just a products video.
KT7KJPagp-I,looks sick mate
KT7KJPagp-I,"Came across this vid. while ""YouSurfing"", travelled the world quite a bit in the last 15 years myself (2 world trips, Japan, Vanuatu, Canada and Alaska, New Zealand, USA...). GREAT tips, very entertaining gents. Thanks very much."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Guys - i was surprised to hear you suggest sweatshirts, jeans - things made of cotton.  I'm planning a trip for the back 1/2 of 2018 and everything I am reading says NO or at least MINIMAL cotton clothing bc it's heavy when wet, takes forever to dry, etc.  And for hiking it's suggested to not have cotton socks too.  Thoughts?"
KT7KJPagp-I,When you say get  a digital copy of your passport you mean take a picture of the page with your picture on it and just email the picture to yourself ?
KT7KJPagp-I,How is this diy?
KT7KJPagp-I,"Question: is it too risky to bring a lot of electronics to a hostel? Like a dslr, laptop, other cameras, phone, tablet etc."
KT7KJPagp-I,BETTER EX-LAX SUGGESTION:
KT7KJPagp-I,TRY A STOOL SOFTENER LIKE DUKALAX. THESE KEEP YOUR POOPS SOFT AND FLOWY IN YOUR BODY. EW. THAT WAY IT ELIMINATES CONSTIPATION AND ALSO THICKENS UP DIARRHEA FOR A BETTER POOP SESH.
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Organizing while staying cool."" :) Great vid, appreciate products list. Maybe tuck into passport organizer a card listing emergency contact # back home, medical info, blood type and insurance#. Use your phone for flashlight needs?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"What you called a ""power converter"" is only and adaptor so you can use different physical plug configurations. Power converters change the voltage from 110 to 220 or vice versa. You won't need a converter in too many places these days for your cameras, laptops, or phones."
KT7KJPagp-I,What about bringing a minimalist first aid kit? What would you put in it?
KT7KJPagp-I,"I have very mixed feelings about this video and the advice it gives. The whole ""credit card and electronics"" bit is quite useless when you are an on-the-rough traveller or from a country that does not have a strong credit card culture. I reckon they target more of an upscale audience. Toiletries belong in a see-through pouch especially if you are travelling carry-on...  Not sure I'd follow any of those advice since I'm already a well-seasoned traveller with zero need for fanciness."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Hahahaha tablet and noise cancelling headphones, are you kidding? What kind of minimalists are you seriously?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Don't host your passport on your email provider's server. Google will now always have it. Encrypt it first (perhaps try 7-zip)
KT7KJPagp-I,I love the digital burrito!!! It's so cute and useful and I'm hungry! Lol
KT7KJPagp-I,Too much tell not enough show. I.E. you talk too much. No substance.
KT7KJPagp-I,Is there any other products you want to sell guys ?? Commercials compilation !
KT7KJPagp-I,Pretty sure those headphones aren't noise cancelling lol
KT7KJPagp-I,13 min of product placement. boring
KT7KJPagp-I,Shoes.
KT7KJPagp-I,"More so than specific brands, the most general thing about clothing is just that cotton kind of sucks while travelling.  Polyester mixes and wool dry in a fraction of the time, which matters if you get caught in the rain, land in a puddle, or need to dry the clothes after washing them in a bathtub, as ya do."
KT7KJPagp-I,"How can you trust someone that considers fedoras as a ""minimalist essential""?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Vitamin B does not prevent mosquito bites"" -Dr Sarah Collins"
KT7KJPagp-I,not very minimalist. I have traveled with half of that stuff. no need for big headphones or tablet. most people don't travel abroad to watch netflix.
KT7KJPagp-I,H
KT7KJPagp-I,which airline lets you bring a waterbottle on board?
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Travel ESSENTIALS""? most of what you showed is superfluous junk that would add to your travel weight and not reduce it. Misleading video."
KT7KJPagp-I,"I'm gonna travel tomorrow and I know i overpacked, but I will go camping so i need some stuff... I overpacked because i had not enough last year and that scared me so I took to much..."
KT7KJPagp-I,why would you get a burrito bag that reminds of you being hungry all the time.....
KT7KJPagp-I,"The definition of minimal, to me, implies that you only use/bring what you deem necessary. Yes, Alex and Marko may have a higher budget than most ""minimalists,"" but that doesn't mean they aren't following a minimalist approach. And the video doesn't have to be a be-all and end-all list. If you don't want to bring an iPad, don't bring one. If you don't want to bring higher-end toiletries, stick to the Wal-Mart stuff. It's about what works for you. They clearly put a lot of effort into their productions, and for guys who are on the road so often and so long, they've found a system that works for them. Instead of chastising them for not conforming to your definition of minimalism, take their suggestions and adapt them to your own situation, and enjoy the videos. I know I do. "
KT7KJPagp-I,Mai bikhari hon mere pass passport  nahi hai
KT7KJPagp-I,Adds...adds..adds..
KT7KJPagp-I,good
KT7KJPagp-I,"I have searched everywhere for that RAINs jacket, and no one sells it in a large anymore..."
KT7KJPagp-I,wow... can't believe you left out antiseptic wipes or hand santizer.
KT7KJPagp-I,Minimalist. Lol. This is just a shill video
KT7KJPagp-I,"I understand a lot of what's recommended in the video, budget aside, but I do have bit of a problem with the headphones. It is important to have something for flights, hostels etc. With that said, I would never take headphones. They're just too bulky and leak sound more easily. On the noise cancelling respect, that is going to be more expensive than a lot of people are willing to pay but it is worth it(more than the bellroy passport holder, say. And I own one of their wallets but don't travel enough for a passport holder to be worth it). I normally spend a lot on earphones so I do it without even thinking. I personally feel noise isolating "
KT7KJPagp-I,??? ????
KT7KJPagp-I,lol essentials cost like $1000
KT7KJPagp-I,oh no the only disapointing thing is you are sheeple!
KT7KJPagp-I,"Just an FYI on the US$100 bills.... last time my mom came to visit me (US to the UK), the exchange place in my town told me they would no longer be accepting US$50s and US$100 bills for exchange.  No idea why, but worth knowing!"
KT7KJPagp-I,I gotta say that burrito is pretty lame. Can't you just put them in a small pocket...?
KT7KJPagp-I,"makeup is fun, but for traveling, its just way easier to bring no makeup, unless you need skincare stuff"
KT7KJPagp-I,Big water bottles are so unnecessary to bring. just pick up a soda bottle on the trip and refill that.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Great info! For women, I'd like to suggest a dark, light-weight, elastic-waist maxi skirt; a long-sleeve lightweight dark sweater and a dark pashmina that doubles as a head scarf. They're ALWAYS in my day pack when I'm wearing shorts and a tank top and are handy when I want to tour a conservative church, temple or mosque. On the days I'm wearing sandals, I also throw a pair of thin black socks into my backpack."
KT7KJPagp-I,Bakhsheesh means loose change in Arabic.
KT7KJPagp-I,This video feels really fake
KT7KJPagp-I,"mate, say minimalist on the title is cool but that is NOT minimalism. I usually travel with 20 things less."
KT7KJPagp-I,You can get free bank accounts that have no atm fees all around the world
KT7KJPagp-I,Sounds like a bunch of advertisements .
KT7KJPagp-I,"Thoughts on no tech whatsoever, not even a phone for my multi month backpacking trip thru S America? I don't think I need one because this trip is going to be all about being present and no photos or videos or social media. Plus, most hostels have computers. I can keep in touch with people by writing down their numbers or social media handles. I wonder if it could present an issue with getting from the airport to hostel."
KT7KJPagp-I,"What the heck are those eyeshades? LOL Also, how in the world do you hang a nalgene on the seat in front of you? Where is there something to hook a carribeaner to on a seat?"
KT7KJPagp-I,Good Job Alex & Marco.  It's not easy but you both are doing the best.   Please try to mention always the prices from A-Z if possible.  I know it is difficult but very very essential.  It might help many to prepare a close up budget.  Food Vlog as well pls. Vegetarians!  we are a lot.  Keep the good work.  Thanks.
KT7KJPagp-I,"This is the exact opposite of minimalism. You guys are either purposive deceivers, or just simple schmucks; but not minimalists."
KT7KJPagp-I,"That is not Marco, thats Juan Mata"
KT7KJPagp-I,Obviuosly you're guys Only 1 or 3 underwear? Gross lol
KT7KJPagp-I,lol minimalist...
KT7KJPagp-I,"???????? esta supeeer esta lista de tips, lista para viajar ?????????????"
KT7KJPagp-I,"It all depends on the climate you are going to travel to, and for how long you are going. If you travel to/from somewhere like Siberia in winter, you'll need more than one jacket. Even now a days it's quite rare to get a flight to and from Moscow on the same day, and you'll probably have to stay at least 7/12 hours there. Unless you're totally fine with lounging in the airport and wasting your time, you'll need a jacket for -5/15 for Moscow and a totally different one (expect -25/-35) when you arrive to wherever you are going in Siberia. I've travelled a lot from Europe there, and it's like - +5 in the place you are leaving, -15 in Moscow, -35 in the town in Siberia, and through a two week stay, the weather will change twice from -10 to -35. Actually, traveling in winter, from one climate to another, is often quite tricky for shoes as well, cause dry snow, wet snow and rainy weather, mean very different shoes. I have seen so many people coming to Siberia, sure they would have enough with their ""warm"" western jacket and shoes, it's actually pretty sad. I'm quite sure it goes just as badly in most Scandinavian countries in winter, at least as far as Finland goes. And if you are planning on taking a trip across one of those countries, you'd better have a fix of clothes that don't simply imply layers. Many germans froze to death in 1943, thinking layers would save them. Learn on them nazi mistakes."
KT7KJPagp-I,isn't bacsis romanian
KT7KJPagp-I,How about TRAVALA? They are launching alpha verion on 18th of july. Travel/book hotels up to 40% cheaper with Travala
KT7KJPagp-I,are you guys homosexuals?
KT7KJPagp-I,Superman and batman
KT7KJPagp-I,Yeey bakšiš!
KT7KJPagp-I,How do you wash your clothes? Do you take small clothes washing liquid bottles with you or does normal handsoap actually do the job?
KT7KJPagp-I,"There are so many product pugs on an ""essentials video?"" None of these things are essentials. An essentials video should be 5 minutes. I get needing to get sponsors to do this professionally, but the amount of time spent on them to dilutes the content."
KT7KJPagp-I,"I think the advice is highly recommended, I will apply it and spread it to my colleagues. Thank you."
KT7KJPagp-I,Bakshish is the Indian version of tip.
KT7KJPagp-I,The guy on the right is cringy
KT7KJPagp-I,My essentials (more that what you noticed here): 
KT7KJPagp-I,"1. a pen - you always need a pen, of course. Mine is five in one! (4 colors, a pencil and a rubber!) super lovely Pilot (https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-4-1-Light-4-Color-0.7-mm-Ballpoint-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Pencil-Blue-Black-Body/pd/3347"
KT7KJPagp-I,You guys should do a video for people who are afraid of flying.
KT7KJPagp-I,"*Camera, gps, e-book, phone ...  all charge with usb. To be able to charge all at once I use the ICY BOX IB-AC6104 usb hub that provides 4 usb ports. It's important that it has an external power supply. "
KT7KJPagp-I,*I use the soaps you get for free in hotels until they're finished. To carry them in my bag I use a small zip bag. Saves weight and space. I reinforced it with tape.
KT7KJPagp-I,"crisp 100USD bills should be issued in 2006 or later,many countries don't accept the earlier bills(esp south east asia)"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Do jetlags depend mostly on the person? Because I'm travelling to Spain this week which has 2:30 hour time difference and I'd like to know if that could give me a jetlag (sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes, English isn't my first language)"
KT7KJPagp-I,So the adapter for your electronic equipment you mentioned England?     Guys it's not England ok it's Britian there are 4 nations make up the Britian mentioning 1 of them is disrespecting the other 3.    It's not difficult there is a world map behind you I'm sure you research what you vlog about try it on countries.
KT7KJPagp-I,Nobody...I mean like NOBODY ever asks other people for condoms. You guys are dumb.
KT7KJPagp-I,"wow, a box manfragrance.... really.. minimalist.. you guys need some serious lessons in travel light.. hahahahahahahaha.. cellphone, credit card passport sunblock and shades.. nothing more..."
KT7KJPagp-I,Z
KT7KJPagp-I,"1. What is the universal converter used? I don't see it in the links above. Or maybe I'm blind. If so, sorry. "
KT7KJPagp-I,"2. The Nomadix towel is LIFE. It's not a ""minimalist"" pack towel, but it's better than going to a tropical place, staying in hostel, and not having a beach or hiking/river towel."
KT7KJPagp-I,Water jug is useful but it's everywhere these day so...foldable porta john is useful not just camping with kitty litter-could save many toilet trips?
KT7KJPagp-I,Baksheesh means tip in Hindi
KT7KJPagp-I,Its not that minimalist to be honest
KT7KJPagp-I,"Most of these are not essential, this is a pretty bad list."
KT7KJPagp-I,"I never bring condom, for a different reason."
KT7KJPagp-I,"You guys are great but Mnimalists? Even in the winter I pack less bulk. And alot of those fancy things can be replaced with less bulky stuff like plain old ziplock bags, and items from the dollar store or the thrift store."
KT7KJPagp-I,Starting off by discussing how condoms are essential for a traveler? With strange partners? Yeah great way to exhibit American (im)morality. And yeah.. that's your priority when traveling? A couple Jerks
KT7KJPagp-I,"Take money.  Take passport.  Ok, never would have thought of that.  Put cell phone in Airplane mode and then use Wifi.  Yea, works great.  Wow.  2 mins in and I know these are clowns."
KT7KJPagp-I,Are these guys a couple? Disgusting
KT7KJPagp-I,"ON POINT ;) don't mind the haters guys! I know the gear you're carrying and promoting is a little upscale for most of us budget backpackers buttt, the general packing pretty much mirrors my essential items packing list for long-term backpacking (aka. 1-2 years at a time). The longer you travel, the more you get better at culling and only keeping the quality, important stuff hey! "
KT7KJPagp-I,- Well that was and interesting intro lol
KT7KJPagp-I,"You have a few different essentials that I do, that's for sure."
KT7KJPagp-I,Baksheesh is tips in Arabic.
KT7KJPagp-I,seems very convenient but the digital burrito is a ripoff as far as price goes it costs $18.00 But you have to pay 15.00 for S&H plus taxes if you get it from the Jansport website
KT7KJPagp-I,Them beats are not noise cancelling
KT7KJPagp-I,"So for the water bottle, It's fine if you take a bottle on board with you right? As long as it is empty when you pass through security? I have a big one and am scared they wont let me in with my bottle.. nervous laugh"
KT7KJPagp-I,For minimal a knidle and phone with a decent camera is a good idea like a s7 onwards. dont bother with a point and shoot camera as its a pain to have and is bulky unless your really into photos. A pasport holder is stupid and bulky gopro is really not needed and forget noise cancelling bulky headphones a set of skullcandy smokin buds 2 block alot of noise and are tiny and dont scream rob me plus beats are junk. a journal while nice is bulky compared to a phone app
KT7KJPagp-I,England is in Europe.
KT7KJPagp-I,The minimalists would be disgusted
KT7KJPagp-I,This isn't minimalist.
KT7KJPagp-I,"You mention Google Maps but if you’re travelling in a country whose language you don’t speak fluently, Google Translate is a godsend.  You can download language packs to use offline and call it up anytime for quick translations.  I always like Duolingoing a language for a few weeks or months before departure too, but obviously that’s a lot more work and only gets you so far."
KT7KJPagp-I,brothers who get on well are disgusting
KT7KJPagp-I,"Hand sanitizer and a whole box full of lotions? If you're gonna take so many liquids in a carry on, you need to at least mention to make sure they fit in a quart sized bag for airport security. I assume that will be in the next video, yes?"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Four years of travel vloging? Here's a tip: Get a degree next time. Oh no wait–  these guys supposedly learnt more from travelling than you ever could from school, right? Bullshit."
KT7KJPagp-I,I would not recommend any synthetic puffy for travel if you want to be cost effective in the long term. Down will last a lot longer after repeated stuffing if you just want one layer. (Not as chic)
KT7KJPagp-I,A better option would be a 100 or 200 weight fleece and a windshirt. A much more versatile layering combination for various climates.
KT7KJPagp-I,If you travel you will know that it is more effective settling with a pricey gadget that will last you a long time than spending the same amount buying cheaper ones over and over.  I found your tips here super legit.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Also, if you can afford them and you don't need toooo many memory cards will save space and weight compared to external hard drives.   I normally have a 4TB external on me but over time have been slowly adjust things over (and keep backups in a couple externals at friends' places and backups online... I don't have a set place at all, so).  And love the mention of Ex-Officio undies!!"
KT7KJPagp-I,uhm nope this is NOT how a minimalist would travel. these guys carry way more stuff than my parents would
KT7KJPagp-I,"That's cool that Netflix is allowing pre-download, but do you have to be in The states to pre-download?   We are already driving to Panama over next couple years. Oh shameless plug we too have a vlog of our journey. As you know it's hard to edit on the road so we just started releasing our first Episodes a couple months ago even though we have been on the road for 7 months and we are in Guatemala already."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Hey gents, you forgot to mention the cellphone should be SIM UNLOCKED. For phones nowadays that means you can just purchase a sim card in the destination country and avoid the roaming charges and have cellphone service for dirt cheap. I had a 1 month plan in Australia for $10 last time and could use it because my phone is unlocked. Saved a ton of money there that way."
KT7KJPagp-I,Hi VAGABROTHERS!
KT7KJPagp-I,If you change Minimalist to efficient... Now I don't have to make those mistakes. :D I'll Try any ways when I get money that is lol
KT7KJPagp-I,Guys ? Girls ? what about apache helicopters ???? racist ...
KT7KJPagp-I,I seriously love these guys. I'm preparing for travel and their advice is really helpful!
KT7KJPagp-I,"""Girls, we won't mention make-up because it's not 100% necessary, sorry bout that"" but absolutely no mention of women's toiletries that ARE 100% necessary."
KT7KJPagp-I,These guys must be rich ass kids.
KT7KJPagp-I,"I dig you guys. Hey""minimalist"" simply shouldn't entertain full-size noise cancelling headphones as an essential and certainly not anything that is Bluetooth. The fewer cords, batteries and chargers that are in you pack, the better you are doing. Cheap earplugs do the job, or better yet a pair of IEM (in-ear-monitor) style headphones - they're tiny and double as earplugs and headphones. "
KT7KJPagp-I,"Who are the idiots this video is targeted to? ""Bring cash it's handy if the bank has issues"" ""Bring your atm cards so you can get more cash"" I mean come on!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"A minimalist/3-1-1 ""hack"" is to make toothpaste dots.  Put down a pea-sized dab of toothpaste and let it dry.  After that you can put them in a snack sized ziplock and it will not count as a liquid.  When you're ready, wet your brush wet the dot, put it on your brush get down to business.   "
KT7KJPagp-I,"you can only be a minimalist because you have the whole of society supporting you.  All you really need is your wallet with money of course, and you won't need to pack anything. :)"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Casually flashing your Magnum sized Love Gloves to 1.7 million people, i see what you guys did there.. Sweet move"
KT7KJPagp-I,melatonin hurts my stomach.  just make sure not to netflix and drink  ha jk.  u guys are awsome
KT7KJPagp-I,"?Better than Exlax or other laxatives is a natural solution: 2 teaspoons of pure natural SEA SALT or pink Himalayan salt (NOT table salt with iodine) dissolve in 32 ounces of warm water. Drink it fast (within 5 minutes (it’s optional), lay on your right side for a little while if you can, massage tummy too (optional) stay near a bathroom...works every time, usually within 2 hours!!! Natural sea salt is usually available in most countries around the world."
KT7KJPagp-I,"THE PILLS PART IS NOT A GOOD IDEA!    It's handy having things combined or out of original packaging UNTIL you hit a customs control that gets interested.   An unfortunately large amount of my space is taken up by my prescription meds plus OTC vitamins (that I need due to surgery in the past) and Tylenol variations and whatnots.   I've been through a few uncomfortable customs clearances where if I didn't have everything prescription or varying-by-country OTC status clearly noted - and in one especially nosy case thankfully for a couple meds copies of the prescription paperwork from previous fillings with me - things've made for more than just the thankfully only some stress caused and no fines or worse.   And it's not as though I'm carrying hard painkillers or used-for-entertainment meds lol.   Just taking those darn vitamins out of their ridiculously oversized packaging would make my life so much easier... I'm thinking of writing the company that makes them before next order to ask if they had non-standard options available.    The biggest awesomeness I've found with meds/vitamins isn't something that really helps us when we get our meds strictly while in the US, but if you can get a refill in... heck, any other country I've done so in yet...  they have everything given to you in the flat blisterpacks instead of the pain in the butt to pack bottles!   Curse you, USA packaging!!!"
KT7KJPagp-I,"I know this video is a little over a year old BUT about the ATM card and fees...if you open up a Checking account with Charles Schwab you get a debit card that offers no fees for withdrawls while traveling. It's pretty legit, look into it"
KT7KJPagp-I,This is not minimalist at all.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Bakshish is Indian Hindi word meaning a gift. The word is also used by the bell boys/waiters in hotel or the taxi drivers etc asking for a tip. Example: Sir kuch bakshish mil jata toh... (Sir, it would be great if you would give us some tip)"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Minimalist?  Not really.  Many useful items, but the bag with all this stuff would weigh more than 10 kilos.  Sounds like a wild shopping extravaganza for wealthy travelers.  You should really disclose that you receive payment when people use your links.  Pretty disingenuous not to do so."
KT7KJPagp-I,Condoms?? Nonono WE GO IN RAW
KT7KJPagp-I,"Lol these guys desperate to get extra money to get through product commercial.. this is how youtubers make money.. if you buy product through their links, they get commission. Maybe maybe useful for who never traveled, but otherwise just full of commercial lol"
KT7KJPagp-I,"Don't feel like you have to go all out with this stuff. The advice being given is solid, but don't let the prices discourage you from getting out there. Not everything you get has to be priced as though it was made from Beyoncé's tears. Granted, your dopp bag might not end up being constructed of ripstop material, but does it really need to be? Here's a savings of more than $500 to start with before chiseling away at some of the other items where the margins might not be so large:-Digital burrito ($18) vs. zip bag for a child's school binder ($1) = $17 saved-ExOfficio mesh boxer briefs ($26x3) vs. Russell mesh boxer briefs ($12x3) = $42-Banana Republic traveler jean ($118x2) vs. Columbia Cascades Explorer Pants ($50x2) = $136-Typical Patagonia tech shirt ($45) vs. Russell tech shirt ($8) = $37-Patagonia puff jacket ($200) vs. Heat Keep puff jacket ($30) = $170*-Rain waterproof jacket ($100) vs. Paradox waterproof breathable rain jacket ($40) = $60-Jaxon crushable fedora ($48) vs. generic wide-brim floppy hat ($10) = $38-Nomadix travel towel ($55 most designs) vs. REI XL towel ($23) = $32**-F&R solid cologne ($25 for 0.5 oz) vs. In about 20 minutes you can make 6 mini Altoids tins (about 0.5 oz. each) worth for $12 total, or $2 per tin. = $23 saved per tin.*This depends on where you're traveling. If there's going to be serious cold weather, go with a better puff jacket. But considering that these minimalist travelers tend to spend 90% of their time in Southeast Asia, tropical climates and the more temperate European countries ...**Listed as an XL, this is about 18.5"" shorter and 5"" narrower than the Nomadix option. It's also about 12 oz. lighter."
KT7KJPagp-I,Worst advice ever.
KT7KJPagp-I,"The world is not so credit card friendly as you guys have said. Even in Europe, some countries such as Germany have a strong cash culture. In small towns in so many destinations is almost impossible to buy anything with a credit card. It´s important to do some homework about your destination."
KT7KJPagp-I,"Sex outside of marriage is fornication an is a sin, don't promote sin!"
KT7KJPagp-I,seriously. noise cancelling headphones?
KT7KJPagp-I,since you said bagsheesh and hasheesh why dont you make a whole video speaking arabic and putting subtitles.
KT7KJPagp-I,Refillable water bottles are on any travel itinerary but they are not very useful in Asia or Africa because you can't drink water unless it is filtered which in my experience hasn't been easily available. Although the Safari bus in Africa had its own water tank they put something in the water to purify it but one person still got sick from that water. It pains me to say this but bottled water is the go for me.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Why would you bother stealing people's time by telling them to pack a thick jacket, when they are going skiing!? ""Oh damnit, Jerry.. someone should have told us that the snow is freezing.."" Advising people to bring passports or money? Charging cables? Wow.. this is the most useless video, I have seen in.. ages.. no offense.."
KT7KJPagp-I,Typical rich pretty boys. 
KT7KJPagp-I,Basic boys travel essentials:
KT7KJPagp-I,"Small amount of clothes (few t shirts, shorts, 1 pair of long pants, 1 pair of shoes, 1 pair of thongs (flip flops) 2 pairs of underwear. "
KT7KJPagp-I,The fakest people I have ever seen.
KT7KJPagp-I,"Emailing yourself a photo of your passport is really bad advice, email is NOT secure. Check out a secure cloud service such as spideroak or tresorit that is actually secure. "
