fBZcZuImlDw,"Guys... I have a suggestion for you... U have to spread your organization to all over country or world i should say.. bcoz... Firstly, Blue cross in india have avoided the ambulance services for which.. in other states, so many dogs or other animals are dying or maybe crying for help... in which we have to carry them to the community... But the problem lies to the people. (I can carry them... But all the people can't be like me right??) So if you have another branch of your organization in other states of the country or the world, the people who loves dogs but afraid to touch them can contact you directly so that they can seek help from you..."

The mom even thanked the man with a paw shake.

IMxdjKaRlfg,Snake: dude am not dead am a living headless snake
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: Calls Mom
IMxdjKaRlfg,Snake: dont tell ur mom.
IMxdjKaRlfg,when vsco girls hear that turtles can live after death SKSKSKKSKSKSKS WE SAVED THE TURTLES
IMxdjKaRlfg,Edit: how did this blow up in one day?
IMxdjKaRlfg,Edit 2: this has too many likes ?
IMxdjKaRlfg,Can’t wait for the upcoming videos;
IMxdjKaRlfg,10 Poor People that are Rich
IMxdjKaRlfg,10 Dogs that are Cats
IMxdjKaRlfg,Who else came here because of the headless snake?
IMxdjKaRlfg,"how the snake still alive, he just got his darn head cut off."
IMxdjKaRlfg,i can not eat after this im just gonna starve to death like a freaken animal
IMxdjKaRlfg,"If they live after death, they have never actually died"
IMxdjKaRlfg,If they can ‘live after death’ then clearly they are not dead.
IMxdjKaRlfg,Who came here because they thought the dead snake with red eyes was cool?
IMxdjKaRlfg,They should call this video animals  that still move after death
IMxdjKaRlfg,Can we just take a second to notice how he says...
IMxdjKaRlfg,Voldemort to Harry: See you not the only boy who lived
IMxdjKaRlfg,this is my reacshion to a spider 
IMxdjKaRlfg,me: mom im going to play outside 
IMxdjKaRlfg,mom: be carful 
IMxdjKaRlfg,Moral of the story is :everyone will dead
IMxdjKaRlfg,Except Deadpool ?
IMxdjKaRlfg,Bruh
IMxdjKaRlfg,They just used totem of undying
IMxdjKaRlfg,“Were you killed?”
IMxdjKaRlfg,"“Sadly, Yes”"
IMxdjKaRlfg,“But I lived!”
IMxdjKaRlfg,I know another animal the can survive with it’s tail cut of a lizard
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: scary cockroach that has its head off...
IMxdjKaRlfg,Cockroach: I see you.
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: forgets the cockroach is headless ITS A TALKING COCKROACH
IMxdjKaRlfg,new title : 10 animals that can survive with their heads chopped off

IMxdjKaRlfg,Title: 10 animals that can stay alive after DEATH
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me:?
IMxdjKaRlfg,“Living after death” 
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: Bish That ain’t death
IMxdjKaRlfg,0:23 - Cockroaches
IMxdjKaRlfg,1:35 - Bees
IMxdjKaRlfg,2:23 - Chickens
IMxdjKaRlfg,3:19 - Octopus
IMxdjKaRlfg,It upsets  me greatly that the octopus (by most standards) is still alive after being chopped up - its nervous system still functions and the poor intelligent creature feels pain while diners sit there laughing at its coordinated efforts to stand up. This co-ordination itself is proof that its brain is functioning.
IMxdjKaRlfg,This video is mostly....
IMxdjKaRlfg,99% animals can live without his head.
IMxdjKaRlfg,Snapping turtles too. You cut the head off and it’s like a snake. It still snaps!

IMxdjKaRlfg,Deadpool Has Entered The Chat
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: sees the title
IMxdjKaRlfg,"Also me: can this be everybody I love and respect, or we"
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me thinking: If they live after death.. that means..
IMxdjKaRlfg,Also me: gets cockroach spray
IMxdjKaRlfg,sorry the sneck was dead the movements are the reaction of muscles relaxing once it dies.
IMxdjKaRlfg,Just me and read the title and thought that don’t make sense ??
IMxdjKaRlfg,Living after “death” isn’t considered dead then
IMxdjKaRlfg,1% of ppl watching this: * wants to see  the list *
IMxdjKaRlfg,99% of ppl: OMG HEADLESS SNAKE IS STILL ALIVE?!
IMxdjKaRlfg,If animals live after death then doesn’t that mean they are not dead?
IMxdjKaRlfg,"""Number 8 Chickens"""
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: never eat chickens lmao
IMxdjKaRlfg,"Me: So if I’m dead inside, does that mean I’m still alive?"
IMxdjKaRlfg,Other people: well yes but no...
IMxdjKaRlfg,Once my uncle took out the whole inside of a fish and it was still flopping
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: watch’s the octopus one
IMxdjKaRlfg,Octopus: move drastically 
IMxdjKaRlfg,"When my dad was a kid, he found a snake and took it to his class to show them, and wasn’t holding it correctly, by the middle, and it turned around and bit him, and he started to try to pull it off, and it bit harder and harder, until my dad pulled its head off. The head kept biting and the body fell to the ground, and started to go towards one of his classmates. His teacher just sat there and watched it happen, and started laughing after"
IMxdjKaRlfg,Oh my goodness...A headless snake?!I never knew that...
IMxdjKaRlfg,HOLY MOLY THESE ARE SCARY
IMxdjKaRlfg,When they said chicken I  heard shickens ??????
IMxdjKaRlfg,"""They can live after dying"""
IMxdjKaRlfg,So they weren't dead at all?
IMxdjKaRlfg,Illuminati music plays
IMxdjKaRlfg,“Live after death” smh
IMxdjKaRlfg,When you said that bees can still live after it stings people it reminded me of when I got stung in 2017
IMxdjKaRlfg,Music in this if you guys wanna find it:

IMxdjKaRlfg,"Lol this should have been named ""top ten animals who are literally zombie"""
IMxdjKaRlfg,Press this if you agree
IMxdjKaRlfg, | 
IMxdjKaRlfg, |
IMxdjKaRlfg,The narrator kinda sounds like Jack Black ?
IMxdjKaRlfg,"The fact that this guy called the cockroaches ""tiny"" is enough proof that he himself may not be human!"
IMxdjKaRlfg,The salamandar~
IMxdjKaRlfg,casually shows clips of axolotls
IMxdjKaRlfg,What I like about octopus is even you're eating them their still alive.
IMxdjKaRlfg,Title: Ten Animals that can live after death
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me: Everyone can live after death
IMxdjKaRlfg,Me when ima kill a cockroache: :D

Once after he and i had gotten in a fight and i had welts all down my back, i ran it to the barn, saddled up my horse, but my step father caught up with me as i was mounting up. He tried to pull me off of misty but misty kicked him in the stomach hard enough that it threw him back a couple feet. And my noble steed took off. I vaguely remember galloping and riding around for hours. When we returned home, both drained, my momwas home from work and i was able to go to sleep in peace.

gkyNhQ5Pmoo,"One of my dogs saved my life and I will owe him for as long as we both live. I had recently moved onto a new rural property that had been abandoned for 10+ years. There was a lot of wildlife that had gotten used to being in / around the what was now inhabited area. It was very early in the morning and I had put my dogs outside in one of the dog yards that fed off into a larger dog yard. All the fencing is chain link with several gates throughout the yards to separate if needed. It was September and still very dark out at the time I was walking along the perimeter of the fencing to a gate further away to gather a different dog to bring her in the house. To my right I heard some growling and turned to see 3 coyotes only 20 - 30' from me snarling and advancing towards me. All of the dogs were barking at the fence, but it did not scare the coyotes away. I had my back up against the fence, yelling at them to try to intimidate them into backing off. The coyotes continued to advance and were almost about to attack me when I heard a large crack and metal on metal sound. My male Newfoundland (170+ lbs) had jumped up and broken the bolts on the hinge of the gate with the force of his jump and had gotten out. He rushed to my side and plowed into the coyotes. It was the same sound you here when football players hit each other. It was a raging ball of fur, snarling, teeth and coyote screaming. I rushed back to my house and grabbed my walking stick that was at the front door and a flash light. I ran back out to save my dog, but by then they were all in the out field and out of my view. I heard the fight go on for what seemed like hours, but was only really seconds / 2 minutes at best. I called for my dog as soon as it was silent and he came trotting back up to me, tail wagging and sniffed me all over to make sure I was okay. I was terrified he had gotten hurt because there was blood all over his coat, so I took him inside and got him into the tub. Other than some fur clumps and a scratch above his eye on his forehead, he was fine. He and I took a trip to the vet that morning and the vet stitched up his forehead, and then we picked up an extra steak on the way home as a thank you for saving me. It has been more than 6 years since that day, my boy is 9 now and every time I look at him, I thank him in my head for being my hero. I would have been seriously injured if not killed if it were not for my boy that day."
gkyNhQ5Pmoo,"So, I was on a walk (keep in mind I live almost in the middle of nowhere) and I pushed down really hard, there was a lone wolf on my back... u know trying to kill me. It was the end I thought... but then thee was a Winnie and a wild stallion came to my rescue. He followed me home and now he is my best friend. I name him ""Savior"""

Before he got there 2 young adult guys, late teens, maybe early 20's came out of nowhere and started hitting and slapping me. Being such a tiny female for my age, I had no way of stopping what I knew deep down they intended to do. My dog however snuck up and attacked both of them, going from one to the other back and forth until they ran off screaming. I know he saved my life that night. 2 years later he saved me again during a break in. I'll never forget that dog."

gkyNhQ5Pmoo,?
gkyNhQ5Pmoo,when i was around 7 years old  we had boxes in the hallway that a rat was hiding behind. but my 13 year old cat goldie was chaseing it. i was in my bedroon doorway holding the door frame when the rat came and scratched me. the rat also bit me several times and i almost fell to the floor crying which would have let the rat bite me more. goldie then meowed at me and took me to the living room and onto the sofa. my cat nebular then came and kept me warm while goldie chased the rat and killed it in time so i could go to bed. I know it wasnt much of a life saving one. but it left feeling happy that my two cats could save u from more then 10 bites

As soon as I made contact with the swing, he started to intensely bark and whine. He started stepping in front of the swing because he knew I wouldnt kick him. Then he jumped on my back, pushed me off the swing and dragged me to the other side of the yard. At that moment I saw the swing set collapse.

gkyNhQ5Pmoo,"According to my parents: My cat, who has since passed, saved me from a hawk. I guess my fat chubby head looked like food? I don’t know.  But I was outside, and my cats aren’t allowed outside. My cat had escaped minutes prior and my dad went out to get him. I guess I came to because I like feeling involved. My dad couldn’t catch him because he was busy saving me. We brought him back inside after though. That car is the best thing that happened to my family(tied with his two brothers and sister) and I wish he was still here now. All I have to remember him by is his biological brother, who still takes care of me when I grieve and mourn. The other two, girl and boy, are new kittens"

It was fun at the waterfall and all well and good. When we got back up to the car park there was a rottie (Rottweiler) from one of the houses standing there. Naturally, because my dogs r quite social I let them say hi to each other and they got along well. The dog seemed calm so I reached my hand out to let it smell me then it tried to go for me and bite my hand and my dogs stepped in, scaring them off.

4qH3M3Xst0w,Thanks for spoiling Maddie’s video for me
4qH3M3Xst0w,I really appreciate it Tyler
4qH3M3Xst0w,I think i realized once when she came into your room during one of Her videos to wake you up about some thing. I think yall were going to a show or something
4qH3M3Xst0w,"I haven't get it before lol ???? i just start to watch Maddy and i love you both of you, you're just amazing ??"
4qH3M3Xst0w,I thought you guys were roommates ?
4qH3M3Xst0w,"I find this very humorous, I thought it was obvious to anyone who pays attention. You live streamed together a few times."
4qH3M3Xst0w,Tall definitely have mentioned this on insta...or I somehow magically remember this announcement...cauuseeee
4qH3M3Xst0w,I thought it was common knowledge that you and Maddie lived together... I didn’t realize that it wasn’t like actually stated or whatever
4qH3M3Xst0w,Most of us have known since the BEFORE the move. Most of us just aren't super annoying about it. People have roommates. But I'm sure your household is an absolute blast.
4qH3M3Xst0w,Wait I knew you guys lived together. I have no idea when this came to my knowledge but ive known like since you moved in

4qH3M3Xst0w,Gotta love the unmistakable squeak of a reptile factory vivarium door
4qH3M3Xst0w,Tyler I recently watched your video on the fish roller coaster and I found a video I think you should talk about it's called MY SURPRISE PET COCKATIEL BIRD!! by Paul Cuffaro and it obviously shows he knows nothing about birds compared to the cage size which has plastic perches the cockatiel would have little space to fly in the cage they also begin making comments about how is biting which would mean he's stressed and scared the cockatiel is also screeching which is also a sign he is stressed over all the video is quiet upsetting to me and I think it should be addressed.
4qH3M3Xst0w,Wait I thought it was common knowledge they live together
4qH3M3Xst0w,People didn't know that y'all lived together? Lol I knew since day 1. Thought y'all were just keeping secrets. ;)

4qH3M3Xst0w,"Question about reptiles/snakes/spiders do they get enrichment from human contact? I'm asking because I love the way they look, and I could touch them if I needed to, but I'm not a huge fan of touching reptiles and snakes especially."

V8YDuxPQ7BA,I loved all the stories! I love every animal because of this! I just love animals and I’m very attached to the ones on the list. Especially the pigeon cause it saved 109 peoples lives even when it was wounded I’m shook
V8YDuxPQ7BA,This made me cry
V8YDuxPQ7BA,I've found better ways of getting animals like wolves away from you instead of shooting them use fire works and this can be used against just about any animals besides shooting them honestly that's why I always carry a firework
V8YDuxPQ7BA,How did Bears show mercy to that Man ! ?
V8YDuxPQ7BA,wow :( just wow :(
V8YDuxPQ7BA,video: i'm gonna make you cry and suffer
V8YDuxPQ7BA,me: please no!!

V8YDuxPQ7BA,That was SO CUTE!!! I love animals. The first one was very sad though but very brave and caring for a baby
V8YDuxPQ7BA,I love this video but there so sad ?
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"Wonderful stories. Remember, owning a pet is a lifelong journey with many rewards! It is a lifelong journey though, so be ready to take it on if you adopt a pet :)"
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Awesome!
V8YDuxPQ7BA,When I was a baby my cat ben detected a seizure and he saved my life without him I wouldn't be alive today
V8YDuxPQ7BA,I lost my dog guys. I'm so heart broken.... I can't man....I can't.....
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"My snake didn't exactly save my life but he did save me from a painful moment. I was feeding him a mouse, and the mouse started to crawl up my sleeve when I lost control, and right when the mouse was about to bite me my snake took the mouse and started to constrict it. If it wasn't for my snake that mouse could of drew blood or had a disease that would of sent me to the hospital. I took him from the pet store, he wasn't eating at the pet store, because they were feeding him live I took him home and fed him live and he ate. Always protect and care for a animal even if it is exotic or not."
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Love our pets... Let them feel the comfortable of our care. ?
V8YDuxPQ7BA,You do realize this mood would be differet if the back groud music was dubstup
V8YDuxPQ7BA,1:55 Actually if a bear is looking for food it'll fight any animal that is trying to eat it to sooooooo yeaaah
V8YDuxPQ7BA,???
V8YDuxPQ7BA,My dog saved my life when he came in to my life
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Wait a minute.... if the dog was whimpering how could they know where to go BUSTED I caught you lying
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"This were some amaizing stories and like I always said animals are Awesome and very,very,smart,they'll die to save their masters or humans wish ever but one thing I know is that they are very Loyal and to the animals the meaning of friend is very serious."
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"I was saved from my (agressive) cat by my kitten. My cat lived in the basement because she was far too aggressive. One day, we let her up so she could chill with us. Me and my sister brought her up to our room where she could be on our beds. My cat suddenly started growling and hissing at me and my sister. She pounced at our faces, but before we got hurt, my sister threw my keychain at her. Then, my kitten pounced out from under the bed and we didn't even know she was there. They tumbled down the hall, like a cartoon fight without the dust/smoke and stars. They tumbled down the stairs then my cat retreated into the basement. We gave my kitten a lot of treats, catnip, and love that day."
V8YDuxPQ7BA,So many of these take place in russia
V8YDuxPQ7BA,This is so sad ??????????????

When I didn't notice that a small brown snake was Approaching me, a small black Yorkie came running up and attacked the snake. My mom gave the owner of the dog 80 dollars, and we headed back to our hotel."

I came home after school, and out loud said I should have made the cut deeper (I had recently started self-harm.. I'm out of it now though!). My conure was with me. He screamed right as I said that, jumped on me and started loving me incessantly until I put the scissors back.

V8YDuxPQ7BA,The most unreal save was the bare
V8YDuxPQ7BA,How can animals save their lives
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"When I was about 6-8years old, my grandma kept an untamed black mare who was incredibly aggressive to intruders in her territory. My grandma had broken her back and leg trying to tame the mare, so she had decided to just leave her be, instead of break her in. Being a stupid kid, I saw the mare had straw in her mane and I wanted to help get it out, so I climbed the fence to reach her. That was when the mare started rearing up and snorting in anger that I came into her pen. With a sharp turn, a heavy kick was met with my gut and I was sent flying back a good ten feet. After doubling back, she came charging at me to stomp me to death but my grandma's kind hearted donkey shoved herself between me and the mare, keeping us apart, long enough for me to pull myself to my feet and climb out of the pen. Apparently I never told my family about that incident, even though I swear I did. But my mom found out when I went in for x-rays, some odd years later and the scan detected my broken hip that had apparently healed in an odd way. Well, I haven't experienced any problems now in my life, already getting up there to my mid-20s. I think I'm fine. :P"

V8YDuxPQ7BA,"When I was a little girl around 6 years old back in 1990 our Labrador chow chow mix Shredder saved my life, yes that was her name my mom gave her since that dog loves to chew things to smithereens like my dad’s motorcycle seat...twice and eat my Barbie dolls and stuffed toys, however she was a good dog and loved us to death. Well one day I was playing out in the front yard on our cul-de-sac with Shredder laying down behind the front bushes to stay cool, since there was only one road in from two other one way in roads my mom was at work and my dad was making lunch for us he thought I would be safe. Well a car came slowly down the road as I drew on the sidewalk with chalk and did the turn around the circle at the end of the road. Shredder mu to have sensed something was wrong since she stood up as the car got closer and stopped by me. A man got out and grabbed me quickly trying to pull me into the car making me scream loudly. My dad rushes out of the house hearing my scream and saw Shredder puff the fur on her back and take off across the yard to the man as I was kicking and screaming and laugh herself at him biting his arm with a bark/snarl/growl hybrid making him drop me to which I ran for my dad who was coming at the man with a baseball bat who was trying to shake Shredder off. My dad whacked the living daylights out of the man. My screams had alerted our neighbors who’s kids were my friends I played with and they came out to join the melee. Denny my BFF Carlee mother scooped me up and carried me into our house and tried to sooth my crying as her husband Carl helped my dad beat the crap out of the man who tried to kidnap me. Lynn my other friend Tiffany’s mom called 911 and soon cops came. They had to pull my dad and his mob of buddies who included Carl, John a Navy Veteran who lived next door, Bob who is Tiffany’s dad, Jim my friend Douglas’s dad, and Willie one of my dad childhood friends off the dude. He was beaten to a pulp by the mob. I’m surprised he didn’t die. Shredder came back into the house and sniffed me over before licking me to death. An ambulance was called and took the man away while another ambulance came to check me over of injuries while I spoke to two female police officers who handed me teddy bears. I only had a couple of bruises that were photographed for evidence. The cops searched the man’s car before it was towed away and I found out years later he had rope, duct tape, zip ties, and a knife in the backseat. He was planning on raping and murdering me, that’s what he confessed too. I was never told his name by my parents or anyone else and I was spared from having to testify since he confessed. He tried to sue us for his injuries and tried to get Shredder out down as a dangerous dog. The judge let him have it at that trial, his motion to get paid by our homeowners was denied and tossed out by the judge and the man was told his actions of trying to kidnap, rape, and murder a little girl was that brought his injuries to him by a protective good doggie, and the beat down by the father and family friends of the child. The judge even told the man he’s lucky we don’t have vigilante justice or he would let my dad have some alone time in a locked room with him for an hour. He was also wanted in other states for kidnapping and raping of other children and teens. Fortunately he hadn’t resorted to murder yet, I was going to be the first. After that day I was only allowed to play in the backyard unless I had friends over and their parents were on watch too. Up until high school when I walked to the bus stop did my parents stop following me everywhere. RIP Shredder, you were a good puppy. We still miss you."

V8YDuxPQ7BA,3:43 I've seen that bird before in a book of animals who saved humans lives
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"And people are burning forests. Well, I guess they’re idiots."
V8YDuxPQ7BA,INCREDIBLE STORIES. AND PEOPLE THINKG ANIMALS ARE STUPID. THEY ARE WORTH MORE THEN MOST HUMANS
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Just because it’s a wolf please try not to kill it animals are very important wants they are dead there gone so please don’t kill animals just because they are dangerous
V8YDuxPQ7BA,My Nene is a dog rescurer and she was super weak and she didn't know she had cancer so her two dogs that was by her they keep whining and barking and B my nenes husband told Nene to make the dogs shut up but then thats when he realized that something was wrong with Nene bc she didn't talk or anything so B took her to the hospital and kept her for a week and a half now she is home and doing better

V8YDuxPQ7BA,"First, a bear saves a man"
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"Then, a few stories later, a bear attacks a man"
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Fake stories and those are random pictures
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Not to be rude but don’t forget about the animals that saved the people something could’ve happened to them to.
V8YDuxPQ7BA,The one with the cat who woke up the owner the thing the happened happened to me two days ago!
V8YDuxPQ7BA,This is why we don't deserve animals
V8YDuxPQ7BA,If animals save our lives. Why are we destroying their homes and killing them? Just tell me why. Why would they want to save our lives when we’re destroying theirs.
V8YDuxPQ7BA,Polo is a hero ???????????????????

V8YDuxPQ7BA,The funny thing is that most humans wouldn’t do the same

V8YDuxPQ7BA,I want to believe this but they’re simply not enough facts it’s all hearsay

V8YDuxPQ7BA,wow this is why i like cats
V8YDuxPQ7BA,This Vid Didn't Put Details In It.
V8YDuxPQ7BA,"Hem hem, the on with the pack of wolves in Canada is fake because owning a gun is illegal in Canada. Btw, I'm Canadian so that's why I know."

iGwF3ecEV7U,"4:23 “It’s not uncommon for an animal to be overweight in the wild, this is because most animals need to hunt for food to survive which gives them plenty of exercise and keeps them lean” but if they’re hunting for food they shouldn’t be “obese” because running has them lose pounds you showed a lion and I know lions are carnivores which animals are the only things with meat unlike herbivores food don’t run."
iGwF3ecEV7U,Uncle Fatty FTW
iGwF3ecEV7U,Nice videos.
iGwF3ecEV7U,My wife is not in this list

iGwF3ecEV7U,Oh maybe someone is using video or photo editing software to give these animals weights. I've seen countless documentaries on Nat Geo and you don't see fat animals. If anyone would capture such videos or pics I'd expect it to be Nat Geo.
iGwF3ecEV7U,you cant have anything with animal activist.. Trys to save endangered tigers.. gets attacked by animal activist for giving them to much food.. my god they must be the worst people

iGwF3ecEV7U,He weighs so much stupid autocorrect
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Orangetang is not an animal ...or a word. It's an orangutan. Learn to speak. Also , a mountain lion or a cougar is not the same animal as a lion. They are about as related as a house cat to a lion."

iGwF3ecEV7U,Fattest raccoon   Doraemon
iGwF3ecEV7U,"""Uncle fatty"", naw. Looks more like ""Uncle tumor from human food additives"""
iGwF3ecEV7U,The animals that are in the wild who are obese is more interesting. The ones in parks are somewhat domesticated so it's obvious why they are fat.
iGwF3ecEV7U,Siberian tigers are naturally fatter than it's cousins the sumatran and Bengal tigers
iGwF3ecEV7U,How big an idiot do you have to be to release a trapped rat? They're vermin and vectors for disease. Just find someone with a Jack Russell terrier or a Miniature Pinscher to come a deal with it properly.
iGwF3ecEV7U,Hercules is not fat his just big........ it’s not really nice to call something fat
iGwF3ecEV7U,If the lions food isn’t abundant they shouldn’t be overweight they should be slender
iGwF3ecEV7U,fatass racoon
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Why don't the activists get on all the FAT Obese ""people"" in America? We are now Glorifying it"
iGwF3ecEV7U,You were showing a Puma or a mountain lion when showing lions. That was NOT an African lion...wow.
iGwF3ecEV7U,This is fake Elephant should at No:1
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Sorry but the obesity is mostly in captive animals presumably from poor husbandry...there's a big difference between wild and captive animals. Pretty clumsy title mate, sloppy."
iGwF3ecEV7U,# 6 account is obnoxious. An 8 man rescue mission?!? Eight... seriously? Then they just let it go huh... Not gonna take it out to a wooded area or something? They just let it run off into the town. Geez
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Uncle Fatty isn't fat, he has a massive tumor."
iGwF3ecEV7U,They r not fat they r just cubby
iGwF3ecEV7U,Stop saying fat lion and showing puma pictures.
iGwF3ecEV7U,Every like this comment gets is how many wins you will get in fortnite
iGwF3ecEV7U,Dreams of being all of life
iGwF3ecEV7U,called in to save fat rat
iGwF3ecEV7U,Notice how the fattest animals are the ones kept in captivity.  Humans suck.
iGwF3ecEV7U,Fat is a Merican disease...
iGwF3ecEV7U,"That was a mountain lion, not an African lion you ball bag"
iGwF3ecEV7U,Que the fat american jokes.  Yes...I am.
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Morbidly obese animals are NOT cute! Humans have every right to make themselves obese, but they have NO RIGHT to make any other living being obese! They are subjecting those animals to ALL the ailments that come with obesity, & that is NOT ""love!!"""
iGwF3ecEV7U,Squirrel is not a wild animal
iGwF3ecEV7U,"I think I saw that raccoon once...In a dumpster behing an Arby's...least, I think it was a raccoon"
iGwF3ecEV7U,people who do this to animals should be whipped its a disgusting way to treat animals
iGwF3ecEV7U,That fat “lion” picture is actually a cougar.
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Don’t like to any of e-PEX comments, he is a copy-cat, just look at the comments of 10 abnormally strong animals"
iGwF3ecEV7U,"That ""lionfish a tiger"
iGwF3ecEV7U,Well the first one is
iGwF3ecEV7U,Nobody talking about the bag of Burger King in the squirrel clip. People been feeding the squirrels burgers. Now you know why they're crazy fat.
iGwF3ecEV7U,"I'm just upset by the overindulgence that humans gave to animals. Obesity is a human problem, not a fauna's. It disgust me a lot considering that the some animals themselves didn't notice they're overweight."
iGwF3ecEV7U,"That's a shame.  In most of these overweight animals it had to do with people making them overweight. Then these poor animals suffer all kinds of unnecessary, preventable, disease processes.  It's bad enough we are killing ourselves by over eating, now we've moved on to making otherwise healthy animals sick & causing their premature death."
iGwF3ecEV7U,"I have a video with a rats, yep not 1 but  ""3 Rats"", caught on tape walking  at night and they're way bigger than that. I don't know where the origin of the video is from though"
iGwF3ecEV7U,"As for the Tiger, the rabbit hole goes even deeper; there are Tiger farms full of such fat Tigers in China where visitors can buy food (ducks, chicken, goats, etc) to feed it to them. This fattens them up (which is the goal) so they can get slaughtered later on for their parts (mainly the fur and bones for wine)."
iGwF3ecEV7U,Hercules is not fat
iGwF3ecEV7U,I want to see the lion killed
iGwF3ecEV7U,Hercules is not fat duuh
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Not only are nearly all of these NOT wild animals, but contained ones, but I can't help but scoff a bit about the defense of lions when we've got videos of them gorging in the wilds and sometimes getting quite heavy. Its more of a eat when they can, and sometimes that means overeating situation, but still... they're not exactly the leanest wild cat either. Its made all the more of a joke when they can't even figure out the difference between a cougar and lion."
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Or-ang-a-tan, not ""or-ang-a-tang"""
iGwF3ecEV7U,wow  the Lion
iGwF3ecEV7U,Horrible over feeding
iGwF3ecEV7U,Who thought it was fastest wild animals
iGwF3ecEV7U,Just kill the rat instead of wasting time and energy on it
iGwF3ecEV7U,Can’t believe my brother not on this.I wish he was on it i mean it!!
iGwF3ecEV7U,Horrible editing with a bunch useless facts.  Just show the fat animals already.
iGwF3ecEV7U,BS video. Most of the animals you covered aren’t even wild. They’re pets 
iGwF3ecEV7U,?
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Lol! That monkey. Uncle Fatty. And those Siberian tiger people are wrong for trying to say that those fat ass tigers are perfectly normal. They weren't just fat, they were extremely obese. I could understand a little bit of extra weight, but their lives actually seem endangered from how big they are. They were almost as bad as Uncle Fatty."
iGwF3ecEV7U,Why is my ex not on here
iGwF3ecEV7U,"im 30pounds overweight my dr says , anyone else here obese or overweight here, hey cutie hola @ ya boi lol"
iGwF3ecEV7U,If there’s not a guinea pig on here I swear
iGwF3ecEV7U,Imagine if they did supersize vs superskinny animal style
iGwF3ecEV7U,Uhhhhhhh I’m sorry to say this but they are literally ugly because of their weight
iGwF3ecEV7U,There's all types of squirrels a Mexican squirrel gets so fat so we can eat them ?
iGwF3ecEV7U,Sir. let me correct you for a moment.... HERE ARE THE TOP TEN AMERICANIZED WILD ANIMALS YOU HAVE EVER SEEEN
iGwF3ecEV7U,Why do people  don't get concerned about their obese fellow humans?????
iGwF3ecEV7U,"All these animals human diet in common. So, these are NOT wild animals."
iGwF3ecEV7U,The squirrel didn't live/eat in the wild.
iGwF3ecEV7U,The raccoon didn't live/eat in the wild.
iGwF3ecEV7U,"The penguins' metabolism just changed so that they stock up on more fat, due to global cooling. Not global warming hoax."
iGwF3ecEV7U,All animals matter even rats. Ty for saving
iGwF3ecEV7U,"If a wild animal is fed by humans, it is no longer wild."
iGwF3ecEV7U,I got to say that just like God made different sizes of people he made different sizes of lions and tigers and bears
iGwF3ecEV7U,"Very disrespectful to call the firefighter to save a rat. That is the kind of world that we are living today, sad."
iGwF3ecEV7U,"That rat rescue was so stupid. These animals are a plague. They should have ""rescued"" it from the grate with a cricket bat. "

78AlddTd104,"The most amazing was the tiger that got in, got him some, then when he had gotten all he wanted, got out. So, who’s in control, again?"

ThATkncf8nY,I was watching this with my cat ? ??
ThATkncf8nY,Like if you love animals
ThATkncf8nY,This is why lots of people like animals 
ThATkncf8nY,??
ThATkncf8nY,Parrot:
ThATkncf8nY,"animals can't talk, so they speak with feelings. this means that animals can almost read your mind."
ThATkncf8nY,When I was crying my orange cat comes and snuggles with me
ThATkncf8nY,"When I was around 4  years old, I was having a really bad dream about being on a sailing boat (which is weird, because I love sailing now) and I was apparently really scared. My cat Spud, who is just a couple months older than me, senses my distress through a door and he scratched at it, meowed really loudly, and woke my mom and dad up to come help me. I love my cat, and this comment will NOT get as many likes as how much I love my cat. Wanna know why? "
ThATkncf8nY,"My mom's dog, Echo, was my best friend during my years of child hood. When my mom wasn't around, Echo would watch me and keep me safe. She was like a second mom to me."
ThATkncf8nY,At night. I'd have nightmares and wake up in tears. Echo would come in and snuggle me until I fell back to sleep.
ThATkncf8nY,"6:20 actually, the girl was saved by the lions because her sobs or crying made it sound like a cub crying, so lions got alerted and there they go helped the little girl."
ThATkncf8nY,“unbelievable animals that save human lives”
ThATkncf8nY,Thumbnail: lItErAlLy a dEaD bAbY uNdErWaTeR
ThATkncf8nY,Child: Wee play is fun!
ThATkncf8nY,Dog: I HATE YOU LITTLE KID!
ThATkncf8nY,Cat: NOPE! MAH HUMAN!!
ThATkncf8nY,Dog: Helppppppp
ThATkncf8nY,All animals feel when you're in distress or pain.my second grandma had a cat and she got sick one day and the cat stayed with her and then the cat absorbed the disease and the cat got sick and died. the cat gave his life for my grandma. Usually my husky when I go to the store yells at me and barks at me because she's worried for me. Leave a like if animals are helpful. ??
ThATkncf8nY,"I just imagine me babysitting and there is a parrot saying ""hEy gEt tHe bAbY!!!"""
ThATkncf8nY,When the pig saved the lady it was so cute and there is a book about it
ThATkncf8nY,I was crying then my dog that just happened to be in my room then she just laid on me and made me feel a little better
ThATkncf8nY,The reason those lions saved her is because of her scream. Her scream was like a lion cub in danger so that's why the Lions saved her
ThATkncf8nY,Lol I died when the cat said “Ey ey ey! That’s my human!!” Like c’mon
ThATkncf8nY,YOU THE BEST ANIMALS AND AZZYLAND!!!!!!!!!
ThATkncf8nY,LIKE THIS VID IF YOU THINK SO TOO!!!
ThATkncf8nY,"When I was little there was a fire in  my house and my cat came to my room and was meowing and jumping on me when I woke up I just saw the fire and yea, I woke upah family and we survived, I was so blessed for my cat"
ThATkncf8nY,People : when im sick my dogs cuddle and comfort me 
ThATkncf8nY,ME: well when im sick my dog try to bite my head off-
ThATkncf8nY,Once my aunt my uncle and my grandparents my dog was asleep when she heard the door she woke up and was scared and started barking she was trying to save my life

wW7adGSb2UE,"wow, how do you care for all of those animals, I have a hard time takin care of my tortoise and bearded dragon"
wW7adGSb2UE,"Some of the problems you might be having with the algae/plants dying is that you are removing too much water. You only really want to be removing 1/4 of the tank at a time, with only 1 fish in there the bioload is really low, so you might only need to do 10%. But I'm not 100% on that so only try to do 1/4 change a week"
wW7adGSb2UE,Is Handsome Jack excited for BL3???
wW7adGSb2UE,fun.
wW7adGSb2UE,Great video.   All the animals (enclosures) look good.   Messy Messy animals.... but that's what they do so well   ;)
wW7adGSb2UE,This might be hard to do but would you be able to do a video/review on calcium? I've only used the repashy calcium but I noticed you used the rep-cal herpitive. I know there are so many kinds with some having different benefits.
wW7adGSb2UE,You are the best  I have a bearded dragonAnd he is about 12 inches so should I get him a 40 gallon or a 50 gallon thank you bye please  like

T9GtaWznpv150,Omgomg
T9GtaWznpv151,5:49 you’re welcome boys
T9GtaWznpv152,"I think so many of these animals have feelings and instincts to protect. Something about loving and protecting an injured or crying child is so innate, and the sound of someone in fear is really universal across species and very moving for social animals. I also think the mother bear was in protection mode being with her babies. So she heard an attack and wanted to do away with any predators in the area, and maybe had protection hormones in her with her babies around and this moved her to feel bad for him and want to help. Plus, I get the feeling water mammals can tell we are slow in the water, are small to them like their babies, and have pity. So amazing. I love this earth"

T9GtaWznpv498,To wild animals that save humans lives: thank you very much wild animals you have save our lives nobody do that like you
T9GtaWznpv499,I wish i could be saved by a tiger or idk wolf
T9GtaWznpv500,"I think it's widely agreed upon in the wild that it is simply far, far safer to save humans rather than hurt them, as hurting them often brings swift and brutal vengeance."
T9GtaWznpv501,"After that first story with the lions, just try to tell me in all honesty that you don't believe there is a loving God watching over us. How do you possibly explain that away with something secular?"

mllqeVSsIl169,3:34 harambes ancestors
mllqeVSsIl170,"I think so many of these animals have feelings and instincts to protect. Something about loving and protecting an injured or crying child is so innate, and the sound of someone in fear is really universal across species and very moving for social animals. I also think the mother bear was in protection mode being with her babies. So she heard an attack and wanted to do away with any predators in the area, and maybe had protection hormones in her with her babies around and this moved her to feel bad for him and want to help. Plus, I get the feeling water mammals can tell we are slow in the water, are small to them like their babies, and have pity. So amazing. I love this earth"

mllqeVSsIl428,"Although a dog is not a wild animal, my dog saved my life one night. I was going through chemo because I have brain cancer and during my treatment earlier in the day, a tooth was knocked out. I went to the dentist about two hours after my treatment. I told them I'm on blood thinners. They called my doctor and he said it was fine to get some dental work done. The dentist ended up having to remove the tooth and because of my blood thinners, it wouldn't clot and I bled all night. My dog nipped me, poured her water and food on me... Anything she could, to keep me awake. In the morning, my kids found me and ran over to my parents house - about half an acre - and called 911. I was almost dead when they found me. I was in a coma for 5 days and had a lot of blood transfusions. I had lost over 5 pints of blood. That's the most you can lose without dying. I will forever love her. I got her foot print and name, tattooed above my heart. ?"

mllqeVSsIl953,"Yep, hello Thanks HAL love & help animals thanks for showing us. ANIMALS DONT HAVE FEELING AND THEY DO NOT LOVE PEOPLE! 1000. £DONATION TO YOU!!! For the people with a BRAIN THAT CARE I'll tell you our Wildlife didn’t have an easy go of it in 2018. We lost the LAST male northern white rhino, the vaquita porpoise continued its slide toward extinction, poachers kept targeting pangolins and other rare creatures, and through it all the Trump administration kept trying to whittle away at key protections for endangered species. So with that rough bit of recent history, what does 2019 hold? Well, in most cases it won’t be pretty. There will be more blood, more habitat loss, more legislative attacks and more extinctions Here are some big issues that experts say we should be watching in 2019: Humanity’s ongoing destruction of wildlife will lead to a shrinking of nature, with the average body size of animals falling by a quarter, a study predicts. The researchers estimate that more than 1,000 larger species of mammals and birds will go extinct in the next century, from rhinos to eagles. They say this could lead to the collapse of ecosystems that humans rely on for food and clean water. Humans have wiped out most large creatures from all inhabited continents apart from Africa over the last 125,000 years. This annihilation will accelerate rapidly in the coming years, according to the research The future extinctions can be avoided if radical action is taken to protect wildlife and restore habitats, and the scientists say the new work can help focus efforts on key species. Animal populations have FALLEN BY 60% since 1970, suggesting a SIXTH MASS EXTINCTION of life on Earth is under way caused by the razing of wild areas, hunting and intensive farming. Scientists JUST SAID that human society was in danger from the decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems, with half of natural ecosystems now destroyed and a total of a million species at risk of extinction! “It is worrying that we are losing these big species when *we don’t know their full role,”"

mllqeVSsIl1196,No
mllqeVSsIl1197,"I wish we humans repaid these wonderful selfless animals by kindness rather than killing them for their fur, skin, meat, bones or just fun."
mllqeVSsIl1198,Elephants tend to save people for tsunamis because they hear the rushing waves or the feel the vibration I’m not to sure but I learnt this in Thailand when I went a 2 years or so ago

I felt something smooth on my  leg and said to my cousin, ""Oh sh-t something just touched me!"" Well I felt it again and before I could say anything else, up popped a dolphin. I felt so privileged and honored that he/she picked me to touch. I don't know if there was a shark around, but it has always been a wonderful memory for me! For you people who do this : DON'T EAT DOLPHINS! THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS!!!!!!"
mllqeVSsIl1207,We’re destroying animal’s homes and we’re lowering there population for jewelry and many other things even though we need food it’s cruel.  :( #Savetheanimals #Savetheplanet
mllqeVSsIl1208,If animals save us why not we say them
mllqeVSsIl1209,"Angels (both the fallen (satan's) and God's servants) can enter the bodies of animals and control them, it's in the bible! They can do the same with humans should the person allow them to do so."
mllqeVSsIl1210,Okay okay the story about the whale saving the woman i just gotta say why did you put clips of someone swimming with the camera angles in very weird spots?

mllqeVSsIl1221,Animals can sense very strongly when us humans are in danger and/or are fearful.
mllqeVSsIl1222,So the three lions chased the kidnappers away - without killing anyone - and waited protectingly by the girl's side until help arrived. And yet we call lions feroucious...?
mllqeVSsIl1223,Animals are  cool
mllqeVSsIl1224,sharks most of wont attack humans and the dophins  think the humans are one of them
mllqeVSsIl1225,God had told these animals to help these people fr
mllqeVSsIl1226,Kidnappers are werid there’s a lot of idiots on earth like kidnappers and stalker
mllqeVSsIl1227,The elephant wasn’t a wild animal if she was going to pay a monthly payment to the guardian

mllqeVSsIl1272,Edit: the bear was a black bear too
mllqeVSsIl1273,"The shark you showed that was supposed to be a great white was a grey nurse or raggie tooth, get the right shark pictures if you want credibility."

mllqeVSsIl1287,I'm surprised Horumbe Wasn't on this list
mllqeVSsIl1288,We don't deserve this planet
mllqeVSsIl1289,"Those lions guarding that girl reminded me.  In Africa (don't ask me where) some poachers who were probably after rhino horn or elephant tusks were found the next day by the authorities.  All that was left were the bare skulls, guns and other implements of the poaching trade.  Seems like the lion did not sleep that night."
mllqeVSsIl1290,Came to tell everyone that they got clickbaited avout the bear and cheeta
mllqeVSsIl1291,I think the animals did all these things onperpis
mllqeVSsIl1292,Why isn’t Harambe on this list?.
mllqeVSsIl1293,Thats why all the killer of animals in the jungle stop!
mllqeVSsIl1294,Well the mother bear did save the man it wasn’t really her intention. She saw the man as no threat but saw and mountain lion as one that’s why she went after at. You guys already know this though.
mllqeVSsIl1295,we were at the beach and saw four dolphins they are amazing creatures I love them
mllqeVSsIl1296,i cant belive how people are destroying the homes and even killing some animals when some animals are trying to save our lifes
mllqeVSsIl1297,"Sharks rarely attacc humans and if so it’s about territory or bigger sharks, sharks are simple nice CUTE creatures"
mllqeVSsIl1298,No vid then it sucks i dont want to hear stories
mllqeVSsIl1299,Number 4 is on TV.. the true story is: Nan was going to research on the whales after studying them for over 3 years.. and while doing that one of the humpback whales 'attacked' her.. but was actually saving her from a tiger shark.. another researcher caught it on camera as the whale was saving her. Also a humpback wasn't protecting a another animal from sharks.. it was saving the animal from orcas
mllqeVSsIl1300,Someone tested to see if sharks would attack human blood there a lot of sharks and none showed interest in the human blood
mllqeVSsIl1301,Oh Deer why do humans kidnap other humans? Ok I'm sorry
mllqeVSsIl1302,I’m sorry but John varli VARLI guys varli
mllqeVSsIl1303,Hurricane Katrina more like hurricane tortilla
mllqeVSsIl1304,I have been telling people for years that animals and marine life are worth saving here is the proof snd yet what is being done ...they have all been taken off the endangered species list and hunted to slmost extinction  we need all of the them even sharks to keep the ecosystem alive and for us to continue living . These animals and marine life have families too
mllqeVSsIl1305,This is why I say they there is so much we don't know about animals.  When you think about it humans are the only species on this planets who preys on each other.  Outer space isn't the only thing we don't understand

mllqeVSsIl1324,Animals are saving lives yet we are killing them and some people do it for fun and that's disgusting
mllqeVSsIl1325,Tell these people that the Most High is not real. There is an Almighty who rules in the affairs of every living thing.
mllqeVSsIl1326,"This is why i prefer animals over people. Animals are amazing creatures, and all animal abusers deserve to rot in prison!"
mllqeVSsIl1327,Animals help humans but humans still hunt them down
mllqeVSsIl1328,Never been saved by a wild animal. I got saved by a dog once.
mllqeVSsIl1329,"When I was 11 (it was the early 90's) I had a paper route. Up at the top of the hill from me lived a HUGE husky named Smokey (I met the dog and his elderly owners previously). This dog was easily over 100lbs. He was super friendly and always nice and gentle with all of us neighborhood kids. Basically a huge living teddy bear, he didn't have a fence but nobody cared. Smokey was a good dog and never hurt anybody, all the neighbors liked him. So he was allowed to roam freely. "
mllqeVSsIl1330,He does have to be anonymous for a reason and

mllqeVSsIl1408,"Unfortunately, the most intellectual are the most dangerous. Can't even imagine now how I survived the 25 years of my life living with them. Good thing God never gave us all knowledge in the world. Imagine what we would do with those knowledge?"

mllqeVSsIl1415,"Nicely-tended green spaces in town tend to attract deer at night.  Deers in the rut will sometimes get confused by the pheromones of overly aggressive human males and come looking for a fight.  Usually once they get closer they can tell its not another buck their smelling, but sometimes their own aggression will get the better of them.  I'm guessing that's what happened here."

mllqeVSsIl1429,I already know all those stories some of them were from your last video of animals that saved human lives and some were from another channel that I watch hrt knowable
mllqeVSsIl1430,I've seen every single one of these except #2 before and I thought it was this channel that showed it. I think maybe these people are lucky or God is working through them to save his children from danger. The lion one with the little girl was crazy but maybe they did think she was a hurt cub! I also saw a story where a giant sea turtle helped a woman out by letting her ride on it's back for like 2 days until she was rescued or just found shore! Like I said  I think it's God and his wonderful animals saving us!
mllqeVSsIl1431,Yes more animals saving others!!! Awesome thank you thank you!!!
mllqeVSsIl1432,"Phuket, is not pronounced ""Foo-ket""...  It's actually *POO-KET*."

mllqeVSsIl1487,Lions may have been sent by God.
mllqeVSsIl1488,What about tara the cat.
mllqeVSsIl1489,Ya
mllqeVSsIl1490,"Wasn't that gentle  gorilla destroyed by the zoo after the rescue of the little boy?  If so, why?"
mllqeVSsIl1491,I didn't know they were trying to marry that little girl?! She was like 8!
mllqeVSsIl1492,These where angles in disciuse.
mllqeVSsIl1493,Simba and his fellow lions were just passing by before the movie was shot.
mllqeVSsIl1494,"I wonder if those lions will save the farmers over there or if it was just a funny story of pedophiles hiding their victim in the wrong hut... All cultures tho, right?"
mllqeVSsIl1495,Did they draw the African girl white?
mllqeVSsIl1496,I think animals can be a lot nicer than some humans.
mllqeVSsIl1497,Animals are sent by God to help humans. This is spiritual truth!

mllqeVSsIl1499,7:49 ummmm EXUSE ME ITS QUEENSLAND NOT QUEENSLIND GET UR ENGLISH RIGHT LADY!???
mllqeVSsIl1500,Actually the little girl rode off on the back of a lion. They stop for a quick gazelle and a sip of muddy water and continued on to her village 167 miles away. 8:50...make me dislike the video
mllqeVSsIl1501,I don't think the  bear was trying to  save  the human it was  trying to save itself
mllqeVSsIl1502,I hate people that try to take little girls away from their parents
mllqeVSsIl1503,humans are animals too humans are the wild and dangerous animals the smarter a species is the more hostile they are
mllqeVSsIl1504,Stop destroying animal habitats! Animals save humans!

mllqeVSsIl1509,number 9 the girl was in Africa or India.. and the lions where males
mllqeVSsIl1510,Why animals are created equal.
mllqeVSsIl1511,another reason why we should care for our planet better and protect animals.
mllqeVSsIl1512,"Of course people try to make excuses on WHY these animals saved humans. It couldn't be bc they feel empathy, love towards humans, could it?! Oh no, it's got to be another reason. Stfu!"
mllqeVSsIl1513,How is the gorillas behavior surprising? Humans held and gave her love as a baby. She lovingly held a human baby and carried it to safety. It doesn’t surprise me that she would be capable of loving a human.
mllqeVSsIl1514,Number7 did not tell if parens died. If they did theynshould learn how to swim a situation like that happens
mllqeVSsIl1515,If she was not crying lions wolud have a snack

mllqeVSsIl1518,"Not to be mean but dolphins are very empathetic animals, they save drowning people and have been reported saving people in scary situations"
mllqeVSsIl1519,it’s kind of fake
mllqeVSsIl1520,"Guys, please dont imply intent. Theyre acting out of INSTINCT! Not because they like us or sth. Animals protect their young sometimes the ones of others, its about race preservation. Its evolution. Most of the time they save KIDS, remember? No coincidence, but evolution."

mllqeVSsIl1525,Fake
mllqeVSsIl1526,"Totally FAKE photo shopped pic of bear and what ever big cat that is, just the same one pic of it in the video. Don't insult our intelligence. Wouldn't bother watching the video, you're being conned. Why do folk$ feel the need to go to these measure$.  Ye$ I wonder why?. Money centric US based output no doubt the root cause of it."
mllqeVSsIl1527,Bet it's fake
mllqeVSsIl1528,I bet a least 10 of there's are fake
mllqeVSsIl1529,You see tigers don’t live in northpole niether do bears 
mllqeVSsIl1530,So preety much a little bit clickbait
mllqeVSsIl1531,There stories. Don't get sucked in believing their real and acts of God. Use some common sense people.

mllqeVSsIl1535,Nice videos????????????????????
mllqeVSsIl1536,Fake
mllqeVSsIl1537,"God said let there be animals fish and great beasts fill the earth and it was so.  Adam named all the animals after their kind. In other terms that's how we know that a dolphin is a dolphin and a cow isn't a horse because animal names define their dna. unlike human names. lions once chilled with adam and ate grass, they didn't become vicious hunters and killers until Adam and Eve fell from the grace of God until they sinned. Humans messed it up but just like how sin entered the world through man(Adam) sin was taken blotted out by man (CHRIST) God took a rib out of adam side to make eve that's why man is defined scientifically as a Y and women are defined as X. when you take a rib out of Y and add something to that Y it becomes and X... 2 God be all the Glory.."
mllqeVSsIl1538,This is fake
mllqeVSsIl1539,No proof no nothin besides and annoying voice

mllqeVSsIl1558,U know how cats and dogs are enemies?
mllqeVSsIl1559,"Well, mountain lions are actually enemies with bears"
mllqeVSsIl1560,Fake story must not be post
mllqeVSsIl1561,"Yet another channel hiring in a talentless female to narrate, when she had NOTHING to do with the video and researching it. "
mllqeVSsIl1562,"Seriously., why hire in someone else who can't do your job and give them all the glory???"
mllqeVSsIl1563,This shows that animals do have feelings. How else can you explain why they would save these humans. We should remember that animals are living things just like us and that they have their own minds to. When I hear stories like this it gives me hope that one day people will realize that if animals can see if you meant why can’t we save animals?
mllqeVSsIl1564,No real footage = DISLIKE
mllqeVSsIl1565,"The parents drowned oh well, but hey, the beavers saved the boy from the cold! ?"
mllqeVSsIl1566,Animals better than gun..
mllqeVSsIl1567,Katrina is annoying
mllqeVSsIl1568,"Every day , a boy or girl is getting kidnapped, and animals are saving them, but people harm the planet by cutting trees, destroying homes of animals, they are here to protect us from bad guys, and THIS IS HOW OTHERS TREAT THEM.  I Know people can help the animals,  rescue, and so much more! But this is what they get. Kids, if you are reading this,  when you grow up, Save the animals that are endangered in the wild! "
mllqeVSsIl1569,Your channel is cringe and it sucks
mllqeVSsIl1570,"Hey Katrina, #9, ....Ethiopians are black, why are you using white cartoon girl, white police and white doctor?? If you going to use video clips to describe the situation, try a little harder, lol."
mllqeVSsIl1571,Dolphins savings swimmers from sharks are pretty dumb due to dolphins and sharks are natural enemies and sharks don’t attack people in most occasions
mllqeVSsIl1572,HOW DARE U ANIAMLS SAVE HUMANS U R SUPPOSE TO EAT THEM LET THEM DIE LIKE THEY KILLED UR KIND
mllqeVSsIl1573,Not all heros are human??
mllqeVSsIl1574,Tbh I bet a human can beat a mountain lion
mllqeVSsIl1575,6. Gorilla saves 3 year old boy
mllqeVSsIl1576,"Man idk why but I can't listen to female voices, had to leave . In my defense Science proves deeper , masculine voices are subconsciously easier to believe and pay attention to ."
mllqeVSsIl1577,All random photos....?????????????????????????????

mllqeVSsIl1579,If you liked the video hit this button
mllqeVSsIl1580,"According to ""Worlds List"", the girl was kidnapped by 4 men, not 7"

B5e03Ytec679,Actually tarsiers are in bohol island phillipines ima phillipinian
B5e03Ytec680,"The video will be way better if you can put some real footages of each animal in it rather than just using animation. For example, in 6:27 Instead of a picture, can we have a short footage of climbing ? Good video though. Keep up the good work."
B5e03Ytec681,"They're not super heroes in animal world, they're animals with super abilities, but not heroes"
B5e03Ytec682,Spider?? is Spider Man of animal world

9ca7dIAq5wA,Nala didn’t go out looking for Simba - she was out searching for food which is when she crossed paths with Simba.
10ca7dIAq5wA,"I'm a simple person, I see Disney. I click"
11ca7dIAq5wA,"I wondered who could top Simba and Nala. Then I saw #1 and thought, ""Who else?"""
12ca7dIAq5wA,"To be honest when I saw #2, I thought Simba and Nala should have been #1. I had forgotten about Mickey and Minnie to be honest."
13ca7dIAq5wA,Animal couples are CUTE ?
14ca7dIAq5wA,Bonnie Hopps and Stu Hopps are a great rabbit couple!
15ca7dIAq5wA,I love Disney and I love Lady and the Tramp ??
16ca7dIAq5wA,Edit: and some others too in this vid
17ca7dIAq5wA,Robin Hood and Maid Marian are a great fox couple and Bonnie and Stu are a great rabbit couple.
18ca7dIAq5wA,Fox and  the  Hound  So  underrated   but  dark   as  heck
19ca7dIAq5wA,"#5 I think Pongo made a new relationship for his master, Roger that."
20ca7dIAq5wA,My number 1 will always be Lady and The Tramp.  Can't beat that story
21ca7dIAq5wA,Awww all these get you right in the feels! ????
22ca7dIAq5wA,See lady and the tramp
23ca7dIAq5wA,Lady and the Tramp was the 1st movie I saw on VHS and my mom bought me my own copy of the movie for my birthday one year. ??
24ca7dIAq5wA,Click for spoilers 
25ca7dIAq5wA,Lady and the tramp should by number 2 and thomas and dutches should by match higher
26ca7dIAq5wA,No scamp and angel? 
27ca7dIAq5wA,Kovu and Kiara ?
28ca7dIAq5wA,Is it bad that i prefer Kovu and Kiara over Simba and Nala?
29ca7dIAq5wA,Well for me it would be Simba and nahala but my favourite animated couple of all of animation has to be hiccup and Astrid they are such good characters I'm sorry but that's my opinion
30ca7dIAq5wA,Thanks for making my suggestions and crediting me.
31ca7dIAq5wA,"Me watching this video: Simba and Nala should be number one, even if they’re related (they definitely are)."
32ca7dIAq5wA,9:55 - WHAAAAT?????! ?
33ca7dIAq5wA,Great list ? but where is Kiara and Kovu?
34ca7dIAq5wA,Great list!
35ca7dIAq5wA,I think Bambi was promoted as a love story back in the 1940s.
36ca7dIAq5wA,I've always loved the fox and the hound and 101  
37ca7dIAq5wA,Delmations.
38ca7dIAq5wA,I’m betting we can all guess who is going to be #1. Hint: “Who’s the leaders of the club that’s made for you and me?”
39ca7dIAq5wA,My Number 1 Will Always Be Simba and Nala
40ca7dIAq5wA,Because They're Soo Cute And I Love Their Love Song 
41ca7dIAq5wA,Can you feel the love tonight??
42ca7dIAq5wA,I'm finally early?
43ca7dIAq5wA,Hot take: these couples are better than most of the princess couples.
44ca7dIAq5wA,I expected Kovu and Kiara to be on this list.
45ca7dIAq5wA,Mickey and Minnie is my favorite all time Disney couple!! ?? 
46ca7dIAq5wA,Simba and Nala 
47ca7dIAq5wA,Lady and Tramp 
48ca7dIAq5wA,TOD & VIXEY THE FOX AND THE HOUND TOO CUTE I LOVED IT??????????
49ca7dIAq5wA,"Even if they aren't animals, Stitch and Angel will always be my favorite Disney couple?"
50ca7dIAq5wA,Kovu and Kiria should have been on here.
51ca7dIAq5wA,This one hit me in all of the nostalgia points.
52ca7dIAq5wA,Omg you included robin hood and maid marian!! My favorite though is lady and tramp ?
53ca7dIAq5wA,"9:03 This right here makes me wonder if they've seen the movie.  Before they met again as full-grown lions, Nala was under the impression that Simba was dead.  She was simply looking for food and fortunately, found him to be alive."
54ca7dIAq5wA,BAMBI & FALINE YOUNG LOVE TOO CUTE ??????
55ca7dIAq5wA,Never realized how much I wanted this list until seeing the video...
56ca7dIAq5wA,Love Disney ???
57ca7dIAq5wA,Such sweetness so nice?
58ca7dIAq5wA,Yasss
59ca7dIAq5wA,All of These Couples we're meant For each Other
60ca7dIAq5wA,Clucky is soooo underrated.
61ca7dIAq5wA,almost cried when 101 dalmatians came on
62ca7dIAq5wA,I love FINDING DORY and the honorable mention of ZOOTOPIA!
63ca7dIAq5wA,When I saw lady and the tramp in 3 I said: what? How can they don't be in 1st? 
64ca7dIAq5wA,Sees the first
65ca7dIAq5wA,Never mind
66ca7dIAq5wA,Welp. You got me right at my heartstrings.
67ca7dIAq5wA,I'll give you my example of the cutest Disney animal couple: Max and Roxanne from A Goofy Movie.
68ca7dIAq5wA,"Well since Bambi was raised by his father whos is the great Prince, of course, he grows up to be strong and brave, and Bambi and Faline had a bit more interaction in Bambi 2."
69ca7dIAq5wA,Bambi and Faline are my favorites!
70ca7dIAq5wA,"Pongo and Perdita are my top choice. They got their owners together and spent an entire movie saving their kids from death. Then they adopted over eighty other kids, no questions asked."
71ca7dIAq5wA,Beautiful couples comes in all shapes & sizes! Mickey & Minnie will always be our favorite couple! ????
72ca7dIAq5wA,Pongo and Perdita; Jenny and Charlie = Best parents ever
73ca7dIAq5wA,My entire childhood .. ??
74ca7dIAq5wA,ROBIN HOOD & MAID MARIAN BEAUTIFUL COUPLE ?????????
75ca7dIAq5wA,8:34 simba and nala its 2 plass 1st its mike ?
76ca7dIAq5wA,I hope one day to see Judy and Nick in this list. ??????
77ca7dIAq5wA,"The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite Disney movies true it was underrated and sure it was released during the Disney Dark Age but it's one of the most heartwarming Disney movies ever made, and the love between Tod and Vickey kept bringing me back every time, and it had a bit of a cult following over the years, and it's a beloved Disney classic. Did you know that this was the last Disney movie to involved Don Bluth and Gary Goldman before they left midway through the movie's rocky production to make their own company and worked on The Secret of Nimh? And did you also the first animated movie that Tim Burton worked on in his career before he made it big with The Nightmare before Christmas? And I would love it if Disney would ever consider making a live action remake of this 1981 Disney Classic."
78ca7dIAq5wA,Never been a fan of the 1961 101 dalmatians im sorry ive always prefered the 1996 live action version with glenn close it was the one that i watched the most.
79ca7dIAq5wA,All of these couples are awesome!
80ca7dIAq5wA,Wait until you watch A Goofy Movie.
81ca7dIAq5wA,"Somebody please stop mentioning that really sad ""Titanic"" movie! It made me cry big time because it had a unhappy ending and I really hate unhappy endings! I prefer very happy endings!"
82ca7dIAq5wA,"Lady and Tramp are my favorite animal couple. I love dogs and I love how she comes from a rich family and her poor living on the streets and they fall in love despite being total opposites, I never get tired watching that movie"
83ca7dIAq5wA,"NUMBER 6?!?!?!? Uh, NO! Bernard & Bianca are DEFINITELY #1!"
84ca7dIAq5wA,7:48 don’t do that that’s what they expect you to do! It might be fine for you but what about your puppies? And your puppies’ puppies? Gosh am I the only one who’s outraged here?
85ca7dIAq5wA,I love this Disney animal couples!
86ca7dIAq5wA,All these things makes me ask;  Where did my / our childhood go?!?  ??
87ca7dIAq5wA,"i actually was talking to my mom the other day about the whole ""are Nala and Simba possibly related"" thing and she told me that in real life prides, a lioness and her cubs can come from one pride and become part of another.  so it's possible that Sarafina and Nala came from another pride (maybe Nala's father died or was a lower ranking lion) and joined Mufasa's pride.  so, hopefully they'll clarify that more i the live action movie."
88ca7dIAq5wA,Anything Disney related is click bait ?
89ca7dIAq5wA,"Does anybody remember the bear couple in Fun and Fancy Free, Bongo and Lulubelle?"
90ca7dIAq5wA,What about Scamp and Angel they love each other on lady and the tramp 2
91ca7dIAq5wA,Still waiting for judy and nick ?
92ca7dIAq5wA,I Love Romantic Couples Both Human And Animal
93ca7dIAq5wA,Why i am alway alone :(((((
94ca7dIAq5wA,We may not know if Nala and Simba are related but who here remembers that CANONICALLY Bambi and Faline are cousins?
95ca7dIAq5wA,How the lady and the tramp spaghetti scene should have gone:
96ca7dIAq5wA,Don't touchet my spaghet!
97ca7dIAq5wA,It would be a much better movie if it had that
98ca7dIAq5wA,And 
99ca7dIAq5wA,Kovu & Kiara
100ca7dIAq5wA,Scamp & Angel 
101ca7dIAq5wA,"When I saw Simba and Nala at number 2, I had no idea who would be number 1.  Right when I saw it, all I could say was, ""Of course!"""
102ca7dIAq5wA,All great choices
103ca7dIAq5wA,"Okay, but what about Max and Roxanne? ?"
104ca7dIAq5wA,Lady and Tramp ????????
105ca7dIAq5wA,What about Alpha and Omega?
106ca7dIAq5wA,Skilled m
107ca7dIAq5wA,another Disney video by MsMojo count me in
108ca7dIAq5wA,The best Disney couple ever is 100% Kovu and Kiara!
109ca7dIAq5wA,Of course the most iconic Disney couple of all time would be #1
110ca7dIAq5wA,At first I was thinking.... what?! How can Simba and Nala not be #1?! ?. Then I saw Mickey and Minnie and I was like.... oh yeah. Lol. ??????
111ca7dIAq5wA,17 comment
112ca7dIAq5wA,Lady and the tramp are my favorite animal couple
113ca7dIAq5wA,Bennie Hops and Stu hops 1#
114ca7dIAq5wA,So beautiful cartoons .
115ca7dIAq5wA,"The cat couple is just like lady and the tramp, a nice prissy lady meets a streetwise witty boy. "
116ca7dIAq5wA,BOTH PERFECT!??
117ca7dIAq5wA,Number 1 the lion king 
118ca7dIAq5wA,Number 2 fox and the hound 
119ca7dIAq5wA,Number 3 dalmatians 
120ca7dIAq5wA,Number 4 lady and the tramp
121ca7dIAq5wA,"People who claim they aren't furries, yet watch this video. What do you call them?"
122ca7dIAq5wA,No Scamp and Angel or Kiara and Kovu?
123ca7dIAq5wA,What about Kovu and Kiara????!!!!
124ca7dIAq5wA,Do a video on Disney movies that revolve around animals and make the number one pick dumbo not the lion king
125ca7dIAq5wA,Now for Dreamworks. #1 is Toothless and Hiccup. ?? Sure Hiccup is human but who cares. ?
126ca7dIAq5wA,Russo Taylor died on my birthday
127ca7dIAq5wA,Awesome
128ca7dIAq5wA,I love you Msmoji
129ca7dIAq5wA,Very very great list I like it a lot and a lot of fun too and very funny too
130ca7dIAq5wA,I was hoping Mickey and Minnie would be #1! Do mice count as animals? I like Mickey and Minnie together.
131ca7dIAq5wA,As always of No.1.
132ca7dIAq5wA,"Nala looks more like she's from Scar's side of the family, seeing as yellow fur is the dominant trait, so that would mean they're technically cousins. I mean, Cyrano did it first, so..."
133ca7dIAq5wA,"That or what happens with actual lion prides: there used to be other males until they were exiled to start their own prides, and Nala's father might have actually been one of those lions."
134ca7dIAq5wA,Of course the Big Mouse and his girl made it to numero uno! Who else would it be?
135ca7dIAq5wA,"Meh, I still think Kermit and Miss Piggy should win."
136ca7dIAq5wA,Simba and Nala make a great couple
137ca7dIAq5wA,Skill m
138ca7dIAq5wA,Animal couples > Human couples
139ca7dIAq5wA,Didn't you make this list like ages ago?
140ca7dIAq5wA,Doesn't really seem right puting jenny and charlie on this list since there forgettable characters also Don't get putting Bonnie and stu hopps in the honorable mention
141ca7dIAq5wA,Where is Wall-e and Eve??
142ca7dIAq5wA,The lioness opposite Scar isn't Nala; it's Simba's mother Sarabi.
143ca7dIAq5wA,I like Tod and Vixey as well as Simba and Nala.
144ca7dIAq5wA,I think lady and the tramp the be the number #1??
145ca7dIAq5wA,Nala my grandma + simba the nimba
146ca7dIAq5wA,"What about Nareen and Tiana, the only Disney couple to be human and animal??"
147ca7dIAq5wA,the best disney animals love couples is kenai and nita
148ca7dIAq5wA,Ship ship
149ca7dIAq5wA,Of  course Micky  and  Minnie!
150ca7dIAq5wA,Okay then.
151ca7dIAq5wA,My top 5 were these:
152ca7dIAq5wA,5. Tod×Vixey 
153ca7dIAq5wA,4. Bernard×Bianca 
154ca7dIAq5wA,3. Mickey×Minnie 
155ca7dIAq5wA,Awesome video
156ca7dIAq5wA,So aristocrats expired Aladdin
157ca7dIAq5wA,"There should be a video for top ten Disney bromances. Bambi & Thumper, Copper & Tod, Kuzco & Pacha, Aladdin & Genie, Aladdin & Abu, Cogsworth & Lumiere, Bagheera & Baloo, Timon & Pumbaa ....do it, MsMojo. It's a gold mine."
158ca7dIAq5wA,Rodger and Anita
159ca7dIAq5wA,Of course Mickey and Minnie are number one
160ca7dIAq5wA,Obviously is Mickey and Minnie!
161ca7dIAq5wA,Nice
162ca7dIAq5wA,Mickey + minney
163ca7dIAq5wA,Mickey and Minnie for 90 years
164ca7dIAq5wA,only problem with Robin Hood he was a duke when the evil Prince John stripped Robin Hood of his title and right to marry Maid Marian which forced Robin Hood into a life of crime by becoming an outlaw that serves the people
165ca7dIAq5wA,"Tod and Vixey are the most underrated couple in my opinion. Tod just lost his mother, his best friend, his home and he was left alone in the pouring rain. But the next morning he immediately finds true love I thought Tod was gonna become nothing but looks like Vixey was all he needed to stay safe. It's too bad they didn't get much screen time together"
166ca7dIAq5wA,"My favorite couples on this list are Pongo and Perdita, Bambi and Faline and Tramp and Lady. Those three couples are from three of my favorite Disney movies. Those three movies are 101 Dalmatians, Bambi and Lady and the Tramp. My least favorite Disney movie is The Aristocats. I hate that movie. Yeeeech!"
167ca7dIAq5wA,"and where ""Rio, 2011"""
168ca7dIAq5wA,What your favorites Disney Animal Couples?
169ca7dIAq5wA,Bambi & Faline
170ca7dIAq5wA,Bongo & Lulu
171ca7dIAq5wA,Jaq & Mary
172ca7dIAq5wA,1. Dory's parents are made by Pixar not Walt Disney Animation Studios 
173ca7dIAq5wA,2. This video is counting down the Top 10 most adorable animal couples that are made by Walt Disney Animation Studios 
174ca7dIAq5wA,3. Mickey and Minnie are from the animation studio's first franchise the one that started it all which is none other than the Mickey Mouse franchise
175ca7dIAq5wA,"There should be a video for Top Ten Non Disney Bromances. Charlie and Itchy (All Dogs Go to Heaven 1 and 2), Dennis and Jonathan (Hotel Transylvania 2), Babo and Lou (Uglydolls 2019), Gru and Dru (Despicable Me 3), Max and Snowball (The Secret Life of Pets 1 and 2), Branch and Guy Diamond (Trolls), Buster Moon and Gunther (Sing), Hiccup and Toothless (How to Train Your Dragon), Chuck and Red (The Angry Birds Movie 1 and 2) and SpongeBob and Patrick (The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water)....do it, MsMojo!"
176ca7dIAq5wA,I'm sorry but Nala and Simba go AFTER Lady and Tramp thank you
177ca7dIAq5wA,Of course Mickey and Minnie
178ca7dIAq5wA,"Mickey and Minnie, Bambi and faline, Nala and Simba, and Bernard and Miss Bianca are SO cute! Who else agrees?!"
179ca7dIAq5wA,Kovu and Kiara
180ca7dIAq5wA,Mickey & Minnie will never be topped.
181ca7dIAq5wA,Anyone who mentions Nick and Judy in the comments or wonders why they aren’t included is dumb and probably got dropped in the head as a child as they are not a couple. Only friends
182ca7dIAq5wA,Disney was good back in the days... But now its a joke.
183ca7dIAq5wA,"Disney Animal couples are way better than Disney Princess couples or other Disney couples (expect Carl and Ellie). Plus, who else wasn’t surprise knowing Mickey and Minnie would be #1."
184ca7dIAq5wA,"Why are all the males mostly ""bumbling"" poor or not what society would say was good? I dunno.. Just something i noticed."
185ca7dIAq5wA,My favorites are:
186ca7dIAq5wA,-Pongo 
187ca7dIAq5wA,-Simba
188ca7dIAq5wA,what about Nick and Judy?
189ca7dIAq5wA,Cutest animal Disney couples for me: 
190ca7dIAq5wA,Nick and Judy
191ca7dIAq5wA,Bernard and Bianca
192ca7dIAq5wA,And Simba and Nala
193ca7dIAq5wA,Donald and Daisy are kinda close to Breaking up

kRejHx6W2kg,Purple squirrel looks like normal squirrel to me lol
kRejHx6W2kg,"#6 didn't show a pink panther, just an ordinary leopard.  the video didn't even"
kRejHx6W2kg,show a pic of the spotless cheetah.  but that blue lobster is beautiful.
kRejHx6W2kg,9:48 sure looks like a cheeta specialist.. wow.
kRejHx6W2kg,Epicwildlife  my teacher friends and family love your videos keep doing the good work
kRejHx6W2kg,Epicwildlife  have YouTube channel  maureen Graham  in the purple M l have lots of playlist
kRejHx6W2kg,I have seen an albino cow and buffalo it's true
kRejHx6W2kg,Chimera Cats are Amazing.
kRejHx6W2kg,I love you guys!
kRejHx6W2kg,There are also golden lions.
kRejHx6W2kg,That's just a squirrel.
kRejHx6W2kg,Love u
kRejHx6W2kg,Isn't it pronounced lew-cistic not lew-kism?
kRejHx6W2kg,Albino don't count. The 2 tone zebra baby is so much better.
kRejHx6W2kg,"A lot of these are not ""rare and unusual."" such with the lubber grasshoppers that you can literally find all over here in florida, so much so that Ive caught a few and kept as pets for a while. Also pacman frogs are super common as pets as well, not really rare. "
kRejHx6W2kg,"Majority  of see slugs are very  colorful  and beautiful. Just like most brightly  colored animals, it's a warning  of toxicity. California's coast has  many beautifully  colored sea slugs so you don't have to go to another country to find them."
kRejHx6W2kg,I could be wrong but I thought the black giraffe was rarer. And what about the Albino moose
kRejHx6W2kg,"Does anyone else remember Adam? If so, does anyone know what happened to him?"
kRejHx6W2kg,This is really interesting 
XcahejFvkiE,"Our lives all have waves of different emotions, mental states and life events. when life gets overwhelming and life is off kilter people can either choose a better place for the pets even if they orinally planned on keeping for life or they can watch the animal suffer just like they are. Our statuses change be it mental health or physical health.  Some animals could also not be the right fit, though research was done before. Just like reading up on flowers vs having one in a pot with you in charge of keeping it alive. I can see how this is disappointing but the animals were the priority  getting them somewhere"
XcahejFvkiE,No hate but last time you had to give lots of pets up and now you are just restocking your pet collection. Personally I think this is completely wrong since you have just got a hamster tons of isopods and then this one also even though you might think it is the right choice at the time you may run into a dilemma. All I am saying is that you should take a little more time to think about you decisions and make sure you won’t have to make the same choices as last tome
XcahejFvkiE,"""I feel like I wouldn't get a pet if I knew it wasn't the right decision"" isn't that what you ran into last time tho lol getting new animals to quickly then rehoming them. I don't care that you got a new pet but just saying that may be used against you ?"
XcahejFvkiE,"So this is my first ever comment on YouTube after a couple years of watching! I am that upset that you quickly got 2 new pets after rehoming so many others. This isn’t a good example for a young audience, and the exact opposite of what you preach on your channel. Im unsubscribing, and you were such a favorite for so long!"
XcahejFvkiE,"Terra, I’ve watched you for many years now, and I look forward to all of your videos, you’ve even inspired me to get hamsters in the past and your videos have also provided me with useful advice and information regarding care and welfare, etc."
XcahejFvkiE,"Girl, you’re ridiculous. You rehomed a lot of your animals not even a few months ago and now you’re getting MORE animals! It’s like you love the thrill of getting a new animal but after awhile you get bored of them. You don’t even tame your animals. Honestly you’re awful."
XcahejFvkiE,"Im a little confused and dissapointed at the same time....I was happy that you made a hard decision to rehome some of your animals to help assure they receive the best possible life but seeing you buy a new pet after you just rehomed more than 1? If your going to get a pet, you should be committed to them, full on, and if your going to rehome some animals you already have, maybe you should consider getting another pet isn't in your best interest. I enjoyed supporting you, but at the moment I dont really know how to feel. I wish you luck with your new pet but I really wish you would have kept your old pets instead of rehoming them since you made a commitment to them when you bought them."
XcahejFvkiE,"I don't want to judge anybody, but I am sort of disappointed with your animal purchasing. I thought it was so noble of you to rehome some of your old animals because you knew you couldn't care for them, but I am upset that you were so quick to get two new animals... it makes me wonder if you are just interested in the excitement of buying a new animal, but once you've had them for long enough you get bored and rehome them. I just don't think you should be teaching these values to your younger audience who are more susceptible to these actions."
XcahejFvkiE,What about posting a video on you’re weekly pet routine and how much time you spend on the pets?  Explaining the different personalities and interaction with each to enhance their and your quality of life would be informative.
XcahejFvkiE,Definitely a new leopard gecko ?
XcahejFvkiE,I’m just so...*shoves pet out the door*...overwhelmed...*chucks another pet out the window*...with all of the animals...*flings another pet off the roof*...I have...*flushes another pet down the toilet*
XcahejFvkiE,"More pet? I thought you were ""overwhelmed"""
XcahejFvkiE,"I also wanted to mention that, it's not the 'internet' that decided you had too many pets...you said that. So that might be why people are going to be justifiably miffed."
XcahejFvkiE,Another one? Why? I thought you just got rid of like 6?
XcahejFvkiE,"I love your content, and you take great great care of your pets but this video is a little disappointing. Maybe that’s not the right word, to be fair I’ve been in the position you were recently in before - I kept rodents and someone I used to work with asked me to rehome 4 chinchillas from him. They were horrendously neglected and taking them in was my breaking point. I realised how overwhelmed I was prior to getting them too and make a very heart breaking decision to rehome pretty much all of my rodents. We had one cat at the time and I realised I’d really not been giving him slot of time and love and his personality changed so much for the better. That was a good 5 years ago, we have 3 cats and a dog now and that’s very much my limit, they are our family pets now rather than it being solely my responsibility as my fiancé wasn’t really into the rodents so their care really all sat with me. I know it’s really tough, every time I see cute little animals I want to take them home but I just don’t want to get to that place again. I’m sure you’ve thought this through but it’s still a bit disappointing to see.."
XcahejFvkiE,Steve Kevin Gerb the pickles I like pickles.
XcahejFvkiE,I can’t resist mentioning some of the names remind me of the NBA.
XcahejFvkiE,"I'd love to see a video about Steve's raw diet, I recently switched my dog to raw as well!"
XcahejFvkiE,"I feel like it’s a leopard gecko! So happy for you, can’t wait to meet him and know his background. Keep doing what your doing ??????????"
XcahejFvkiE,Hello from Lawrence ks!! We love pet world
XcahejFvkiE,It's definitely a leopard gecko ?
XcahejFvkiE,If I wasn't so broke and so far from Arizona lol (I live in canada)
XcahejFvkiE,Well i was thinking leo gecko at first but the dishes have me thrown off a little now lol
XcahejFvkiE,Leopard gecko? I want one but have to wait for the right timing. Can’t wait to see you new pet?
XcahejFvkiE,A new leopard gecko! (a guess)
XcahejFvkiE,Oh my!! Thank you for this upload I am soooo excited to go find those oxbow toys!!! Like yes something natural and NEW!!!
XcahejFvkiE,"This video popped up in my newsfeed I have not watched a video since your last new pet video. I tried so hard to be supportive when you had to rehome because I understand life happens. But after reviewing i think I saw this coming you don't even put in the time to tame the animals you have. I won't waste my time trying to convince you what your doing is wrong this is hopefully yo reach you, viewers. Guys, please unsub from her this is not responsible animal care while no I do not buy into the thought process that animals are the same as human babies they are none the less living things not toys. Sometimes life happens and the heartbreaking choice to rehome has to be made but this should be the last possible choice and not taken so lightly that you turn around so soon and get two new pets. If she cared about animals she would not be promoting this behavior this will be the last video I watch of hers and I beg other to stop watching we can't stop animals from being treated like toys but we don't have to support/watch it. So little we can often do about this form of abuse but not supporting it is easy."
XcahejFvkiE,Leopard gecko I love your pet and I know what it is ha ha LOL
XcahejFvkiE,I’m
XcahejFvkiE,Still waiting for your store to open back up! Lol
XcahejFvkiE,"These cones are Polish and are garbage :D For real, be careful, there is too much sugar ;)"
XcahejFvkiE,"That hanging mat toy looks great. Hopefully they'll start stocking them in local petshops to me, I think my rats would love it."
XcahejFvkiE,And I get those Ice-cream cones for my rats and Hamster from a place called ratrations. They do little burger-esc ones as well.
XcahejFvkiE,I just started watching your channel I love your channel. Kevin is absolutely adorable
XcahejFvkiE,Always get excited when u post ??
XcahejFvkiE,I am super disappointed. Animals are for life. When you get them you commit to them for their whole life. Regaurdless of what is going on in YOUR life theirs shouldnt be thrown away because of it. When you get that pet you should have a plan a foster home planned out incase something happens to you or your home. You give your opinions on tons of things on your channel animal rehoming including and them you turn around and do the one thing that is frowned upon. Are you gonna be able to handle the hate when people come for you for this? Or are you gonna pull another this is ruining my health im getting rid of them?
XcahejFvkiE,Awesome keep up the great work
XcahejFvkiE,Leopard geko I'm getting one just don't know when
XcahejFvkiE,Wow you live literally 40 min from me lol

XcahejFvkiE,The cones are French so maybe from Canada?
XcahejFvkiE,Yass ?
XcahejFvkiE,So quick question have you been to Olathe Pet Shop recently because I either saw you or a body double of you

XcahejFvkiE,Leopard gecko?
XcahejFvkiE,Leopard gecko?

XcahejFvkiE,I am hungry ???
XcahejFvkiE,She got a AFT gecko
XcahejFvkiE,Cool new leopard gecko
XcahejFvkiE,"You're a dissapointment honestly, those poor animals you threw aay only to get more"
XcahejFvkiE,"We have Vitapol here in Poland, it is a very bad brand :( Unfortunately they use toxic ingredients"
XcahejFvkiE,LEOPARD GECKO
XcahejFvkiE,I love animals ??
XcahejFvkiE,Ball python
XcahejFvkiE,So clearly you're just interested in the excitement of a new pet. Then you get bored of that new pet and throw it to the wolves. Then go and buy a new pet...wtf
XcahejFvkiE,Fat tail gecko?
XcahejFvkiE,"I feel like its a leopard gecko, or an african fat tail ?"
XcahejFvkiE,Another leopard gecko maybe
XcahejFvkiE,"Enriched life is a brand new line! We're super excited about it! Love, a fan that works pet retail :)"
XcahejFvkiE,"Hey guys, I need $300 to get a bird in less than 3 or 2 wks any ideas? "
XcahejFvkiE,Thanks!
XcahejFvkiE,10th
XcahejFvkiE,Great Video
XcahejFvkiE,Where did you get your Guess t-shirts? They’re nice. I guess they are at guess shop.
XcahejFvkiE,"I love your videos and I am so happy for you reaching 75,000! You totally deserved it! I wish I could come to Petfest but I will not be able to. I wish the best for you in your everyday life."
XcahejFvkiE,You are now banned from speaking about taylor nicole dean
XcahejFvkiE,WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?? ANOTHER PET ANOTHER GETTING RID OF OTHERS!!! GET A GRIP!!! VERY - VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU!! PETS ARE FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XcahejFvkiE,Hi
XcahejFvkiE,I'm guessing a small reptile with legs not sure exactly what kind
XcahejFvkiE,Disappointed tbh
XcahejFvkiE,Disappointed but not surprised :(
XcahejFvkiE,African fat tail?
XcahejFvkiE,"Gurl got herself another leo, and I love it!"
XcahejFvkiE,"I'm not any type of reptile expert. I only owned fish, cats, Dogs, and hamsters. But that's a gecko ? Imma guess it's a leopard gecko. Since that's one of the only type I know."
XcahejFvkiE,Like if u got here ASAP
XcahejFvkiE,African fat tailed gecko ?
XcahejFvkiE,"I just can't get on board with this. I'd feel so terribly guilty for re-homing my small animals, only to replace them months later. How is this fair to those animals that were rehomed because of your supposed stress load? It just feels wrong to me. History does repeat itself and I see more rehoming happening in the future, unfortunately."
XcahejFvkiE,"I think a leopard gecko, but a hatchling or juvi as the enclosure is too small to an adult."
XcahejFvkiE,yikes.
XcahejFvkiE,YAYYYYYYYY Im so happy I love this channel!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XcahejFvkiE,sigh
XcahejFvkiE,Here we go again.
XcahejFvkiE,Great haul! Can't wait to see the new ssshhhh leopard gecko!
XcahejFvkiE,Hi. I love your channel
XcahejFvkiE,Did you get an African fat tail gecko?
XcahejFvkiE,First ??
XcahejFvkiE,Loved your haul x
XcahejFvkiE,Woow tara really! Another pet lets pray you wont do any more rehoming?? as the last pets you got dont deserve to be rehomed in anycase i hope you stick through with the commitment ?
XcahejFvkiE,"You take great care of your pets, and seem to have the funds for vet care if needed...so good for you and the new pet!"
XcahejFvkiE,leopard or fat tailed gecko
XcahejFvkiE,"Don't understand the rehoming of many pets a few months ago because you wanted them to get the attention they deserved and now you are getting more pets. I understand life issues change good to bad and vice versa...but, animal care is a BIG commitment and good times or bad they deserve to be purchased or adopted with that understanding and the number of pets should be the number one importance. You may want more pets that catch your eye but you NEED to STOP and think if you have the time AND money to make that animal a happy healthy member of your family.  Rehoming is ok for immediate emergency or health problems, but it's not a remedy for ""I don't have the time for the amount I have"". Sorry."
XcahejFvkiE,"Nothing you can do? UMM, YES!!! NOT GET A NEW PET AFTER YOU GOT RID OF OTHERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU!!"
XcahejFvkiE,great haul!!!
XcahejFvkiE,I'm going to go against the grain here and guess African fat tailed gecko.
XcahejFvkiE,jesus christ you just rehomed several of your animals because you said you couldnt cope with them STOP GETTING MORE. do you realise how ridiculous this seems? look after the animals youve got why do you need more when you literally just downsized?
XcahejFvkiE,Hermit Crab?
XcahejFvkiE,"You rehomed animals and proceed to buy more? Animals need a forever home, please bear this in mind before buying more :(.  You were my favourite petTuber too :(."
XcahejFvkiE,"Pretty obvious that she got caught up in the pet tube community, felt the pressure to accumulate more and more interesting and exotic animals in order to keep interest as making hamster care videos wasn’t enough anymore. Then the reality strikes of the true responsibility of keeping animals, she rehomes some, but the desire to stay relevant and keep up with pet tube remains the same and now she’s back collecting animals again. There is no need to get more animals especially as she seems to have a serious problem right now with animals passing away unexpectedly. What’s wrong with settling with the animals you have ?"
XcahejFvkiE,I wish I was allowed to have that many pets
XcahejFvkiE,You are great your doing awesome
XcahejFvkiE,It’s either a leopard gecko or an African fat tail
XcahejFvkiE,Haha lovely new animal I’m guessing it’s a gecko maybe a leopard gecko
XcahejFvkiE,Disappointing
XcahejFvkiE,Not to be rude but didn’t you just rehome a bunch of your pets cause you were overwhelmed?? Why would you get more when you abandoned the ones you already had??
XcahejFvkiE,African fat tail gecko? Only so many geckos for horizontal tanks..... Or cave gecko......
XcahejFvkiE,Lepered geco
XcahejFvkiE,First
XcahejFvkiE,"God, you need to stop... Rehoming your pets only to buy more, stop being so scummy"
XcahejFvkiE,I’m going with a weird guess but is it an African fat tailed gecko 
XcahejFvkiE,Please give me a shout out if it is 
XcahejFvkiE,Thanks so much and it doesn’t matter what the internet says 
XcahejFvkiE,Have a good one
XcahejFvkiE,"I'm thinking it's probably a reptile, but I really have no idea. As long as you can provide it with everything it needs, which I'm sure you will, it'll be fine. What people think doesn't matter."
XcahejFvkiE,so happy for you and i love your channel i have 2 gerbils 1 hamster 2 cats 2 dogs and 4 guinea pigs and last but not least my new baby bunny
XcahejFvkiE,leopard geckos!!!
XcahejFvkiE,Can't wait till we see the new leopard gecko
XcahejFvkiE,Hi I'm fairly new to your channel I found it because I was thinking about getting some gennia pigs or a hampster. I was doing research.. I still haven't decided what to do.. but I do want to say if people don't like you're choices of how you deal with your pets they don't have to watch ? I know as a pet lover that we follow are heart and gut instinct on how to make are choices. As far as I can see you take good care of your pets and home. So people should just shut up and deal with it. Any way have a good weekend ? see you next time
XcahejFvkiE,"screeches did you get another leopard gecko?!!! Ugh I will die! I have a firewater just like Filepe, and may I just say mine looks like a blob compared to him! (Don't tell Rinley!!) I can't wait till Rinley (my babe) gets older and establishes his full colours. Can't wait to find out what your new kiddo is!"
XcahejFvkiE,Im not judging. 
XcahejFvkiE, Ppl r judging but u  have your reasons and it's not our job to judge you 
XcahejFvkiE,If u dont like this Dont watch it...
XcahejFvkiE,But I love u terra!?
XcahejFvkiE,You adopted a gecko!
XcahejFvkiE,"Those Whimzee chews are great!  I get them for all my pets -- mice, hamsters, gerbils, rabbits and the chinchilla.  I hope to see that grass playmat here soon!  Looks like it would keep some of my menagerie busy for a while.  Don't worry about the ""haters"".  As long as your pets are happy and healthy, that's what is important ;)"
XcahejFvkiE,A cat
XcahejFvkiE,Whatever you  feel  what animal  you are capable of  taking care of  then who else matters
XcahejFvkiE,Please stop judging Terra! I know she rehomed some of her pets a couple months ago because she couldn't care for all of them. And yes she got a hamster and now this pet but before you know EVERYTHING just don't comment about it. Once we know the whole story it will be a little different. Times may have changed and all so stop judging before you know the whole story! Terra takes care of all her animals and she clearly loves them. I'm sure she knows what she's doing
XcahejFvkiE,Hi I love you videos and keep up your good work!
XcahejFvkiE,Is your new pet a leopard gecko
XcahejFvkiE,Why would anyone be disappointed? ?
XcahejFvkiE,"I’ve never owned a reptile before, only dogs, cats, and smaller animals. I’m currently doing a ton of research on bearded dragons before I move from my apartment into a house & buy a beardie at the end of the summer, so I’m doing a massive amount of research! Your channel is so interesting and informative, but honestly what I love most of all is your attitude. You don’t let the viewers ultimately shape how you run things, and that lets me know you’re being the most authentic version of yourself that you can be. I feel confident watching your videos and I’m excited to subscribe!! Have a good day :-) ?"
XcahejFvkiE,"So I am a little disappointed in getting this new pet also, but I also think some people in the comments are being a bit too harsh. When you introduce your new pet, I really hope you explain why you decided to get another one so soon. I have a feeling I know why, but I don't want to make any assumptions."
XcahejFvkiE,"Look for all the rude people. Would I have gotten a new pet? No! But she rehomed her pets 5 months ago. What is the proper amount of time to wait?! Also why is it anyone else’s business?! Using the excuse “she shouldn’t be promoting this to her young audiences” is ridiculous!!! She’s an adult!!! U can not blame a youtubers purchases as to why children get more pets!! I have kids. If my daughter watched this video and then came and asked me for a pet.... the answer would be no!!! It’s the parents responsibility to not hand their children pets because of an influencer. It’s so funny how people love a person, until they do something you don’t agree with you. Your not her keeper, she is allowed to do what she wants. As Long as all animals are being taken care of and no abuse is occurring.... how about just enjoy the video and keep it moving."
XcahejFvkiE,"People will make mistake and some people get a pet having all the stuff and knowing what it will take to care for it but sometimes life can hit hard and people need to understand that sometimes it is better to re home your pets to someone you know will take good care of them then leave them to not be thrived and cared for because the owner is going though stuff and just needs time. Sometimes you need time can take up to months, so it's better to give your pets homes if you know you may not be able to take care of them. Now I know she is a big inspiration and doing this will ""make people think its okay to re home pets"" even though she said why SHE did and you shouldn't just gets pets and re turn or re home them.  Also shouldn't she be a good inspiration, like, who the hell has the guts to just tell over 70,000 people that you had to get rid of some of your pets. It's already hard because your going through stuff and you just had to give up your pets. I think people should look at it more like that and think of Pickles as being a strong person for telling everyone and doing what's right instead of just leaving her pets to uncared for. Maybe you are 9 or 10 and haven't gone through things yet but when you do you'll realize how hard it is. Just be grateful that she is still here and deciding to make videos for us. She could have been in very dark place right now if she didn't so what she did. So be grateful she did what she did."
XcahejFvkiE,"To everyone hating on her or calling her irresponsible for getting new pets after rehoming a bunch, You don’t know pickle and whatever she’s going through. Though I have no say on what kind of person she is since I don’t know her."
XcahejFvkiE,"It’s ok to say you’re disappointed or happy she got a new animal. But don’t be so quick to judge and automatically assume she’s a terrible person for getting more animals. Who knows she could’ve rehomed her previous animals because she felt unready or maybe feeling down that she feels unable to care for most of them? a lot of us owners get those days where we feel like we neglected our animals (even if you did nothing wrong or made a very minor mistake) and immediately feel terrible and suddenly having the need to give them better homes, sometimes even a recent death of a pet can lead us to think this way."
XcahejFvkiE,To anyone calling her bad life changes people change she might be able to care for the new pets now she also did not abandon animals she rehoused them 2 different things to abandon us to not care were they went to rehome ie finding a good new home so stop this unnecessary judging
XcahejFvkiE,"Why are you feeding a raw diet? Did you not see my comment about how that grain-free dog food may have contributed to Ellie's heart problems? They have dog foods that have zero association with that (some dogs on raw have developed DCM), that has been throughout tested with feeding trials. There's no logical reason to feed anything else unless your dog is allergic or refuses to eat it. There is NO proven benefits to raw whatsoever, but there IS evidence of harm. And those bones can break your dog's teeth. Do your dogs get annual cleanings and x-rays? If not, they can have fractures you may not even know about."
XcahejFvkiE,"I think maybe a crestie or a leopard. Also you do not owe an explanation to anyone! It’s your decision, your life!"
XcahejFvkiE,If  youou don't like her choices unsubscribe that's the most we can do at this point. It's hard to change someone's mind once made up.
XcahejFvkiE,"I'm guessing another leopard gecko. For all the people complaining you gotta relax. It's her life. Another leopard gecko when she already has most of the supplies isn't going to be expensive or time consuming. She rehomed some higher maintenance animals that were not as easy to care for an already having leopard gecko it's easy to add one more into the routine. I do think it might have been a little soon but sometimes the right animal just shows up and you have to go for it. If she's confident she can do it, then I trust her judgement. Y'all need to calm down none of these pet YouTubers can be perfect in every way they also have a life going on behind the scenes that we don't see. Things can change in a short amount of time as an adult."
XcahejFvkiE,"I feel like everyone should shut up hating on her , we don’t know her whole life and she might be in a better position to look after her animals than last time so stop judging "
