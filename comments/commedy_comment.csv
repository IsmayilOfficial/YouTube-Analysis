v8ScRl7rWQQ,"""Started in theater.....Ended in theater!"" HAHA. Perfection."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"Thomas Jefferson had a kid out of wedlock with a slave, Sally Hemmings."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"pretty good, we need more uploads steve!"
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Thankyou(:!! & also thankyou for coming to Bullhead!! Enjoyed your performance very much.
v8ScRl7rWQQ,From now on when I say first on a new video I mean George Washington
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Nice to see some versatility in your vids. really cool.
v8ScRl7rWQQ,That was great!
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"also didn't understand the ""neener neener neener"" thing."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"He won the Civil War, and then became president over the very people he was fighting."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"Wait, why was Grant ""niener niener niener""?"
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Ha!
v8ScRl7rWQQ,hahaha
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Pretty much everyone...
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"Because after half of America wanted him dead (Civil War), he won and became president anyway. "
v8ScRl7rWQQ,I got everything but neener neener neener
v8ScRl7rWQQ,I wonder how many people in the current generation understand the Dallas reference.
v8ScRl7rWQQ,I disagree.. Garfield is more well known
v8ScRl7rWQQ,What are you talking about? Garfield was the man!
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"You made a mistake.  When you said ""least famous President to ever be assassinated"", you put up a picture of William McKinley instead of James A. Garfield."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Neener neener neener. 
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"STEVE HOFSTETTER/TROY ALLEN. I didn't understand the Jefferson part, and I reallyyyyy want to. But asking bing&google all these questions to try and figure it out is getting me nowhere. Can I have a name? I'm interested."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,uh hum...cheap shot at Cleveland.
v8ScRl7rWQQ,"...iI'd say Garfield is just as unknown as McKinley.  Both assassinated early in their presidency, both from Northeastern Ohio."
v8ScRl7rWQQ,Starting to feel picked on now that I think about it...gratuitous abuse and double assassination.

IQxptvEL70k,"""Two dollars a gallon"" Ahhh those were the days."

IQxptvEL70k,Lmao!! I want you to come to my school Steve!! your stuff is hilarious
IQxptvEL70k,"Thanks Shelley - if you ask your student activities board, maybe they'll bring me in!"
IQxptvEL70k,"Oh my God, when it was $2 a gallon..."
IQxptvEL70k,$2 a gallon...those were the days
IQxptvEL70k,"I've heard it's like $2.50 in Oklahoma, can't confirm for sure though. I'm up in NH and it's about $3.40 here."
IQxptvEL70k,excellent observations.......
IQxptvEL70k,and comical because it is so f'g true.
IQxptvEL70k,Just resent it! Hopefully you get it and can reply!
IQxptvEL70k,"Seriously, I'm paying almost freaking $4.00."
IQxptvEL70k,"~ Steve is fresher from 2004 than many comedians are in 2018 ~ Thanks, Steve ~ Cheers, DAVEDJ ~"
IQxptvEL70k,Keep in mind this was filmed 8 years ago.
IQxptvEL70k,"But yeah, I still remember being able to take $5 in gas money from friends for taking them on the 2 hour round trip drive to the state line to load up on our weekend supply of alcohol. And the van I drove drank gas like it was water."
IQxptvEL70k,Steve- when are you going to make and post another Q & A video? I made one a couple months ago and emailed it to you and hope to get an answer.
IQxptvEL70k,Lol i love that president oh!bummer (;
IQxptvEL70k,"Don't do it Steve! i heard Shelley Spruill I is definitely hotter, go to her school!"
IQxptvEL70k,more heckler shutdowns!
IQxptvEL70k,2 billion really isnt much on a national scale.
IQxptvEL70k,the farm subsidies is to get them to not farm the same land until it dies. not to mess with supply and demand. but still funny even though the audio was a bit messed up. hard to hear.
IQxptvEL70k,Killing off our politicians is a sacrafice? Kidding.....kinda
IQxptvEL70k,Wtf does he know anything about politics and/or economics?
PDylgzybWAw,"Ah, Murica"
PDylgzybWAw,The magic place where regulation is called communism and freedom means complete absence of any security
PDylgzybWAw,"""It's the circle of debt.. And it screws us allllll..."""
PDylgzybWAw,This is now a million times funnier now that we know he's cast as Zazu in the Lion King remake. XD
PDylgzybWAw,1900% annually? Even the mob doesn't ask that much.
PDylgzybWAw,"I ended up in this when I was working minimum wage part time. I made $600. And was borrowing $200 every 2 weeks after I made a $230 payment. I was renting a room for $300 a month. I had to figure out how to survive on $70 to get to work, pay for a cell phone bill and feed myself. I ended up terminating my room contract, paying off the loan and went homeless. "
PDylgzybWAw,You know what's sad? That the only places on TV in the US where legitimate issues are discussed is on a comedy show.
PDylgzybWAw,they go as high as 2700% APR here in the UK. Absolutely disgusting.
PDylgzybWAw,"Scott Tucker is in prison for 17 years because he joined a tribe to get sovereign immunity. He got caught and exposed, and justice was served. More companies that offer payday loans need to be brought to justice!"
PDylgzybWAw,05:25:00 AM
PDylgzybWAw,Skip forward 3 years. 10 Jul 2017....John Oliver has joined the cast of Jon Favreau's Lion King movie as Zazu.
PDylgzybWAw,"Last Week Tonight on Mobile Homes: ""They're suggesting people SELL THEIR BLOOD! That's horrifying!"""
PDylgzybWAw, 
PDylgzybWAw,Last Week Tonight on Predatory Lending: ----
PDylgzybWAw,The ultimate cause is the lack of education. Personal finances are not taught in school. Even well educated people have to learn through trial and error how to manage their personal finance. I can't imagine just how little someone who lives literally pay check to pay check can managed.
PDylgzybWAw,"I think I have a solution! Go to school, level up your biology skill, steal a syringe, lead Ronshaku Chan to the back room, tranquilize her, stuff her in the costume case, bring her home and tell her dad to release Kokuna Chan's father's debt and congratulations you've just killed your first rival."
PDylgzybWAw,"John Oliver sings a parody of the circle of life, and 3 years later, he gets cast in the lion king. Coincidence, you tell me."
PDylgzybWAw,05:27:00 AM
PDylgzybWAw,John Oliver Lion King audition tape leaked
PDylgzybWAw,"I think ""The Cash Fairy"" is a perfect name for a loan shark's enforcer. He takes your cash and leaves your teeth on your pillow."
PDylgzybWAw,"Debt is slavery. Once in debt, you've become a slave."
PDylgzybWAw,"Two new phrases from this episode: “I call Dingo” and “Where one mole falls, another shall rise”"
PDylgzybWAw,"And it was this rendition of the ""Circle of Life"" that made disney think, "
PDylgzybWAw,"""Yeah, he should be in the live-action Lion King."""
PDylgzybWAw,"This predicted the future. He sang the Circle of Debt song, and now he's Zazu in The Lion King."
PDylgzybWAw,jesus not even the Mob has 1900% interest rates!
PDylgzybWAw,5:31 was that John’s official audition for “The Lion King”?
PDylgzybWAw,You should see the 5-6 racket here in the Philippines. 
PDylgzybWAw,"""I'll lend you 5,000 Pesos and in a week you pay me 6,000 Pesos"""
PDylgzybWAw,"Fast forward to 2019, the director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau went before Congress not too long ago; when asked about the difference between interest rate and APR she didn't really have a clear answer. Then when given a simple scenario for a short term loan and asked to calculate the APR, she went off with some silly talking point rather than just doing the calculation (she was even offered a calculator, lol). When the person responsible for a particular section of government demonstrates a significant lack of knowledge or inclination to actually learn, the prospects for the future seem incredibly depressing."
PDylgzybWAw,"5:27 is, of course, the moment that got John his role as Zazu."
PDylgzybWAw,These guys put the mafia out of business.
PDylgzybWAw,I've made the mistake of taking out a couple of payday loans. Never again.
PDylgzybWAw,Circle of debt is a better joke now that he was in the lion king.
PDylgzybWAw,They should have just made it illegal to charge over 100% on loans under a certain amount.
PDylgzybWAw,"What we need is to give financial basics taught in school. Teach even how to balance your checkbook. Making a budget. Money mutual was being sued. They were harassing people, illegal operations and such."
PDylgzybWAw,"If you live close to a pay day loan store, you’re most likely in a bad area of town."
PDylgzybWAw,"Yeah, about that Sarah..."
PDylgzybWAw,"John Oliver's segments on Municipal Violations, and Bail will show that America can and will throw helpless old people in jail."
PDylgzybWAw,"It's always great to see how ridiculous america can be sometimes, because nobody even cares. Often the cause of the problems is right there in the open for everyone, but noone does anything about it. How many people are in governing positions that at the same time own or were part of big companys? Sometimes, as in the case of Monsanto, people that worked there straightly go in a senate for a few years, then get reemployed at Monsanto. "
PDylgzybWAw,"2:55 Brazilians thinking ""Whats so special about 300% per year?"""
PDylgzybWAw,John Oliver: one of the sanest men on the Internet.
PDylgzybWAw,"i like how he references The Lion King in this, and he’s playing Zazu in the upcoming live-action version"
PDylgzybWAw,5:27 leaked footage of John Oliver's audition for the live action remake of The Lion King.
PDylgzybWAw,@5:27-5:33
PDylgzybWAw,"The precise moment that a masochistic Disney Executive decided that John Oliver would be a good fit for the live-action ""Lion King."""
PDylgzybWAw,05:27:00 AM
PDylgzybWAw,I think I just found his “Lion King” audition tape.
PDylgzybWAw,"is the circle of debs and screw us all, that line there got him that zazu part"
PDylgzybWAw,"When a state representative has interests in payday loan businesses and keeps his position, then something is really wrong."
PDylgzybWAw,5:28 oh that must be how he got the role! ? too good!
PDylgzybWAw,The lack of patterned shirt is genuinely confusing my eyes
PDylgzybWAw,"Medical... bill? I'm sorry I live in the UK, I don't know what that is."
PDylgzybWAw,5:27 Special sneak preview! In theaters 2019
PDylgzybWAw,5:26 John preparing for his role in the new Lion King
PDylgzybWAw,9:08 Does the guy standing behind her whistle? Hilarious!
PDylgzybWAw,"5:27 ""It's the circle of Debt, and it screws us all..."" and now he's playing zazu. funny"
PDylgzybWAw,And that's why I borrow from the Italian mafia
PDylgzybWAw,05:27:00 AM
PDylgzybWAw,"In retrospect, that moment seemed like foreshadowing."
PDylgzybWAw,5:28 foreshadowing from a future Zazu
PDylgzybWAw,“The circle of debt” why isn’t this a song ???
PDylgzybWAw,0:25 It was Starbucks AND McDonald's!!! AND!!!! EVEN MORE THAN YOU SAID WHICH WAS CRAZY TO BEGIN WITH!!!
PDylgzybWAw,"After watching hours of John Oliver's segments, I feel like America is broken in every capacity."
PDylgzybWAw,5:30 the exact moment Disney knew John needed to in Lion King so they remade the whole ass movie
PDylgzybWAw,5:25 I wonder how kids in the future will  view this joke considering how he's in the remake of the lion king
PDylgzybWAw,15:33 And that's when Going in Style was first pitched
PDylgzybWAw,“It’s the circle of debt...” U said it zazu
PDylgzybWAw,"""I'm on  team Bella, she doesn't need a man to define her."" No she needs a good writer to define her."
PDylgzybWAw,"14:04  I would be legitimately afraid of any thug that called themselves ""The Cash Fairy"""
PDylgzybWAw,0:30 there are more Subway stores in the world than McDonalds stores
PDylgzybWAw,Pretty weird seeing Zazu sing the circle of life
PDylgzybWAw,5:29 foreshsdowing for his 2019 lion king?
PDylgzybWAw,"110%: ""Hit him in the mouth, Billy! Hit him in the mouth!"""
PDylgzybWAw,"1600%: ""Genocide, Billy! Genocide is the only option!"" *coach turns into Satan*"
PDylgzybWAw,"Watching this in 2018, where I know John's going to voice Zazu in the upcoming Lion King movie... and the funniest part to me is ""The Circle of Debt"" by a mile. Foreshadowing at its best."
PDylgzybWAw,"""He-hello? Right, I would like to uhm.. Hire someone to pee on me."
PDylgzybWAw,"Uh.. for science."""
PDylgzybWAw,5:27 John Olivier’s audition tape for the live action Lion King
PDylgzybWAw,"14:18 So back to the drugs-analogy again, huh? ""A majority admits it's ruining their lives. But a majority also sais being high is pretty sweet."""
PDylgzybWAw,Bella isn't even on Team Bella.
PDylgzybWAw,"The cash fairy... Comes in the middle of the night when you're sleeping to take money, leaving your teeth under the pillow"
PDylgzybWAw,Love going through these old videos - John Oliver is a national treasure!
PDylgzybWAw,5:27 I can't believe I found John Oliver's 'The Lion King' audition tape
PDylgzybWAw,"Little did Oliver know that when he sang the ""Circle of Debt"", he would be playing a character in the live action Lion King lol."
PDylgzybWAw,"Sadly, most people who get Payday loans probably do not watch John Oliver."
PDylgzybWAw,"""I SEE DEAD DEBT, PEOPLE"" ! ! ! ... (Classic meme, not my own original thought) XD"
PDylgzybWAw,5:28 And now he’s in The Lion King ?
PDylgzybWAw,"Now that John Oliver is in ""The Lion King"" re-watching this video made me find it weirdly prophetic. :D "
PDylgzybWAw,"Love dearly all of John Oliver's work! Inspiring and ""objectively funny""! :)"
PDylgzybWAw,"""Wanna borrow a few bucks at exorbitant rates? Ya get the money right away!""   Look up what exorbitant means."
PDylgzybWAw,"NPR just did a story on payday loans, and they quoted this video. Nice to see the impact you're having on the world!"
PDylgzybWAw,"Each time i watch this show, it's the audience that draws me back. i would love if there was any ""muted audience"" version wink wink"
PDylgzybWAw,5:30 must have been his audition for the lion king
PDylgzybWAw,"7:35 Ah so also for profit Universities, there is a market for that type of bumper sticker. "

PP00uy82Rhc,I have a theory about Rick and morty... EVIL MORTY IS OUR MORTY BUT FROM THE FUTURE... and I know that sounds crazy but think about it Rick has a box labeled time travel stuff but we never seem to get an episode of time travel this could be because he has done it before and it ended up bad
