CFdecZr5IuE,"If you’re reading this I want you to know that God loves you and He cares about you so much that He became a man (Jesus Christ) and died for you. Please accept His Free gift, He is the ONLY way to heaven. You can’t get into heaven by doing good works and you don’t have to go to a priest to confess anything. Cry out to Him through prayer He will not turn you away.  Dive into His word (The Bible) for guidance and do not continue in your sins. Make His word the final say in your life. "
Fql_zy1EuqI,Am I the only one who thinks it's illegal to call it pancake dough instead of pancake mix
Fql_zy1EuqI,Imagine if they forgot to record
Fql_zy1EuqI,How do any of these help you cut costs? ? This channel is hilarious - 64m subscribers? How many are bots?

Fql_zy1EuqI,"I thought this was five minute crafts, not an hour long food recipe compilation. I mean, i ain’t mad about it ?"
Fql_zy1EuqI,Plot twist: all of those real life vs. Commercial tactics were used in this video???
Fql_zy1EuqI,I would like to know how these cut cost in any way 
Fql_zy1EuqI,These are the same hacks as your other videos with a new title just to get views I'm done watching the same thing over and over again just cuz you give it a different name
Fql_zy1EuqI,ive seen nearly all of these hacks about two or 3 times by watching 5 videos of 5 minute crafts i do like them and i do like there channel but they need to put new hacks in people might think different but people i know and me would like at least a new hack in each video or more but otherwise i really like you videos and i have sbscribed :)
Fql_zy1EuqI,8:49 spiders has 8 not 6 legs??????
Fql_zy1EuqI,"HoT chocolate in a slow cooker seems pointless and waste of time and electricity?.  Never-the-less some of the slow cookers recipes are great idea and look pretty good . But, then-again, who does  have the time and energy to try these hacks to begin with? However, These videos are amusing and very stimulating to the mind. I really appreciate the people who work hard to produce this content... God bless"
Fql_zy1EuqI,"You lost me at shaping cookies with an earring . It grossed me out about as much as a cookie shaped in a belly button, but i guess I'm weird that way."
Fql_zy1EuqI,Is anyone really going to take cost cutting advice from a food video that doesn't know the difference between dough and batter lol
Fql_zy1EuqI,you dirty dirty monster!
Fql_zy1EuqI,how could you put those things on pancakes!?
Fql_zy1EuqI,21:38 is it just me or does that bread look moldy?
Fql_zy1EuqI,9 1/2 minutes in and everything has been pancake ideas and cookie decorating. I thought this was supposed to be money saving ideas. How is making pancakes and decorating cookies gonna save me anything?
Fql_zy1EuqI,"Me: hmm , yummy food."
Fql_zy1EuqI,"Me again: Moooom , am hungry "
Fql_zy1EuqI,"Mom: didn't you just finish lunch , still 6 hour for digest ."

Fql_zy1EuqI,Guess what?
Fql_zy1EuqI,2:47 was satisfying
Fql_zy1EuqI,I'm I the only persi who watches but does none of them
Fql_zy1EuqI,Moral of the story : use things the way it’s NOT supposed to be used
Fql_zy1EuqI,And I’m pretteh sure we all know dat right?
Fql_zy1EuqI,2:22 tfw you’re allergic to Nutella and also you don’t like 5-minute crafts
Fql_zy1EuqI,"Don't  know why I put off watching this , but WOW"
Fql_zy1EuqI,also I try the easy things
Fql_zy1EuqI,how you gonna have all that stuff when you are camping
Fql_zy1EuqI,Best of their vids by far? it's so satisfying

Fql_zy1EuqI,perfect wery god 5 minuts craft
Fql_zy1EuqI,The one with fish is slightly nasty in my opinion.

Fql_zy1EuqI,Craft: I’m a rebellion!
Fql_zy1EuqI,Mwa ha ha!
Fql_zy1EuqI,the instructions are weird
Fql_zy1EuqI,These are fascinating. Some are amusing like the pouring milk into the cereal box that’s what those mini cereal boxes are designed for that’s not a hack lol but still these are fun to watch!
Fql_zy1EuqI,My hand fell asleep while o watched this
Fql_zy1EuqI,Bi insan ned?nnn kurd ?eklinde bi ?ey pi?irirkiiiiiii?
Fql_zy1EuqI,2:35 ist anyone sick of the repetition it’s almost like there is no creativity left
Fql_zy1EuqI,The five minutes is what it takes to assemble the spaghetti dish.
Fql_zy1EuqI,"This is how you get diabetes. pancake, chocolate etc....."
Fql_zy1EuqI,It looks so yummy in my tummy

Fql_zy1EuqI,How are these pancake recipes and cookie decorating ideas going to help me cut costs? The title for this video is very misleading...
Fql_zy1EuqI,it pancake batter NOT pancake dough!! 
EtImhRShqUI,"Don’t stop saying “ok so” it’s part of your personality.  That’s why we watch.  We can watch any doofus with a stove cook, but there’s only one Sam the Cooking Guy."

EtImhRShqUI,If you boil the potatoes so they're 75% cooked then roast them they'll be suuuuuuper crispy and crunchy
EtImhRShqUI,"""Jesus take me now... AND I'M JEWISH!"" LOL"
EtImhRShqUI,Sam “Oh queso” the Cooking Guy

EtImhRShqUI,"Just want to say I try this recipe and oh my god is ever good ,it's steak reinvented so succulent and I am Belgian by the way when it comes to fries only the best will do, love the show."
EtImhRShqUI,"MAX,  you need to trick Sam into saying the word SMASH, with an excited look and tone, but another context...  like ""we were driving along, distracted, and...SMASH!!  right into a shopping cart.""  then some regular shots of ""that"", ""like"", and ""buttom""   A little edit later,  you could have a montage of hi/low speed/pitch 'S.T.L.B.'s to insert when needed"

EtImhRShqUI,"“Ok, so” t shirt pls"
EtImhRShqUI,“We don’t eat with our eyes...

EtImhRShqUI,Those frites a little hot there bud? Lol
EtImhRShqUI,Recipe idea: 7-11 Monterey Jack chicken taquitos. I’m addicted to those things ?
EtImhRShqUI,THE RETURN OF GREEN ONION! It's been so long since I've seen you use green onions Sam!
EtImhRShqUI,I get all of your references-I think it's cute.  Makes me smile!!!
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam:  I love your shows...  Next time you make a sandwich with bacon, try ""weaving"" a couple of slices and either bake them or use your flat top with a weight to keep them flat.  I cut two pieces in half and weave them together (to make a square that fits perfectly on bread).  Awesome!"
EtImhRShqUI,I think your thinking of “ The Dating Game”
EtImhRShqUI,We made the steak frites last night and it was absolutely delicious
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam, I love you guys. I've developed my cooking so much watching you guys over the last year. You've touched a lot of lives through these videos in an incredibly positive way. I hope to visit your restaurants sometime soon!"
EtImhRShqUI,Scientist: Oil helps reduce friction and make things non-stick.
EtImhRShqUI,Sam: Oil will help everything stick.
EtImhRShqUI,I love your videos. This is no hate
EtImhRShqUI,"that was a great montage of ""so's"" Max!   : )"
EtImhRShqUI,“Win a chance with chance” or even “win a chance to date chance” lol gotta really play on his name since it’s Chance
EtImhRShqUI,"You mean ""The Dating Game"" when Jim Lange would introduce the three bachelors vying for a date with a hot chick, or vice versa, with Count Basie's ""Fantail"" in the background. I would watch it as a kid. That looks really good. ""And heeeeere they are!!!!""-Jim Lange"
EtImhRShqUI,"Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! It's official Sam, you're mesachistic."
EtImhRShqUI,"""So"" and ""okay, so"" are more commonly used over ""hmm"" or ""uhh"" in the English rhetoric."
EtImhRShqUI,I also have no idea what I'm talking about.
EtImhRShqUI,"""And heeeerre they are"" and ""OK, so..."" are really fine. It's the overuse of ""Gorgeous"" that gets me, Sam.  grin"
EtImhRShqUI,"How about just...""A chance with Chance""?  Eh?  Ehhehehe love you guys!  You make our day.???"
EtImhRShqUI,"Laugh so much with your comment ""Jesus take me now and I'm Jewish!"" ;D"
EtImhRShqUI,I would buy 10 T-Shirts IF they all say Holy Sh!t with Sam face on it lol
EtImhRShqUI,“I’m going to tear that up like a 18 year olds tuna”

EtImhRShqUI,"By Jove Henry. The one time cutting your fingers makes.... well, sense!"
EtImhRShqUI,"I remember the game-  I also remember the best answer ever:  ""In the butt."""
EtImhRShqUI,Never noticed the “okay so” It doesn’t bother me. Don’t fret over it. We are going to do this for dinner! Thankyou! Looks great

EtImhRShqUI,I am a vegetarian. 
EtImhRShqUI,I never watch any cooking shows that feature meat. 
EtImhRShqUI,You have and will always be the only exception. 
EtImhRShqUI,Also.... you have re-inspired me to be a home cook.
EtImhRShqUI,"9:24 It was ""The Dating Game"" hosted by Jim Lange.  It was aired during the same timeframe as Newlywed Game."
EtImhRShqUI,"Canoe of pleasure, with the steak frito it is a Ship of pleasure."
EtImhRShqUI,"Ok Sam, as someone roughly from your age group - ""And here they are"" was actually from The Dating Game"" with Jim Lange. Sorry, not sorry!"
EtImhRShqUI,Okay so.... New shirt!

EtImhRShqUI,18:21 - That was the same sound I made last night when I took a bite out of the steak sandwich I made. God damn that thing was beautiful.
EtImhRShqUI,Your presentation is outstanding. Nice recipe.
EtImhRShqUI,Sam.. yk you’re a genius when yu convinced a non-steak eating person to eat that??
EtImhRShqUI,"This episode you didn't say ""and.... we mix"" ? I forgive you though. This food looks amazing lol"

EtImhRShqUI,Just noticed that Sam and Max have 300 haters . REMEMBER when the Spartans had 300 soldiers protecting their people.  Well they are nothing like that . This is the greatest cooking show of all time !!!! Keep doing what you do !!!!
EtImhRShqUI,I don't know why it bothers me but I wish he had swiped the leftover ingredients into his hand and tossed it into the pan! 7:37
EtImhRShqUI,Say ‘ ok -so’ it makes me feel like we are having a conversation
EtImhRShqUI,"Drinking game. A shot every time he says ""ok so"""

EtImhRShqUI,"""Susan, where the weirdest place you've done it???""  ...  ""I have to say....In the butt, Bob!!""  If you're laughing now, then you're as old as me! Lol"

EtImhRShqUI,"Btw, the s at the end of steak frites is silent"
EtImhRShqUI,"1:13 Yea, you absolutely didnt say something dirty right after that."
EtImhRShqUI,That saying is from the Dating game 
EtImhRShqUI,Mr. NOT NOT??

EtImhRShqUI,A fork and a paring knife have been my flipping friends for years.
EtImhRShqUI,9:20 I'm 19 and I knew that one. Honestly I just knew because of the reference in the first shrek movie lol
EtImhRShqUI,Better Drinking Game:  take a drink every time he says ow or ouch!
EtImhRShqUI,"""OK so"" I hope Max does the editing and final cuts without Sam knowing and he sees these gems of hilarity as we all do and laughs. My favorite thing to watch ever day. Love this show."
EtImhRShqUI,Sam! Can you make something catholic friendly for us that can't have meat on fridays during lent?
EtImhRShqUI,Y’all need to start putting the ingredients in the description! ? these recipes are so good!
EtImhRShqUI,The canoe of pleasure that's why I keep coming back lol
EtImhRShqUI,Love your channel and recipes.. BUT  I get a tad anxious when you have a knife in your hands and start cutting or wielding it in the air as you talk.. lol
EtImhRShqUI,I don’t know if I’m just young but the “and heeeere they are” reminds me of the mirror on the wall from Shrek that did the bachelorette game thing
EtImhRShqUI,If that's wagyu then I'm a flying squirrel.
EtImhRShqUI,"Hey Sam, do you know the difference between a Canadian and a canoe canoes tip, Canadians don't, Love your show"

EtImhRShqUI,"Sam, there's also no exaggeration over how great it is when people say SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON"
EtImhRShqUI,“And herrre they are” is from shrek lol showing my age
EtImhRShqUI,U could use “aaaalllll rightyyyy thaaaannnn! And look at the camera. A bunch will catch on. ( and shake your head while doing so) my 4 cents !
EtImhRShqUI,"I thought ""Win a chance with Chance"" was perfect, really."
EtImhRShqUI,I’m 25 so I don’t know if that makes me a millennial but HELL YEAH I watched The Newlywed Show and Match Game and Press Your Luck when I was a kid. Game Show Network was legit man!
EtImhRShqUI,“You’re in the presence of greatness.”  Hahahaha
EtImhRShqUI,"""And here they are.."" is Jim Lange and ""The Dating Game"". Bob Eubanks got the nod for ""The Newlywed Game""."
EtImhRShqUI,"If I'm honest, I really never notice the ""okay, so"" unless you point it out. I doubt many people actually notice it. Plus, it's much better than actual poor grammar, such as saying phrases like ""more better""."
EtImhRShqUI,I’ve said it before but we really need a “Louis/Astro 2020” t-shirt!
EtImhRShqUI,I'd eat that entire bowl! Great show!
EtImhRShqUI,"""today i'm gonna show you how to cook some good food...but first i'm gonna ramble like a tool for the first 2/3 of the video."""
EtImhRShqUI,I only just discovered your channel.  Guess the  Youtube algorithm finally did something right. I can't get enough and have  been binge-watching as many episodes as I can.
EtImhRShqUI,When watching  I feel like I am just over a friends house for dinner. But oddly never get to eat. 
EtImhRShqUI, I love how you make every recipe seem attainable. I love to cook . I am no chef but I always feel like I can make all your recipes . I love how you show your mistakes too. Makes you seem more reliable. I love how much you really enjoy every bite.  But most of all I love Louis. ??
EtImhRShqUI,?? so funny watching him burn his fingers when flipping the tatters lol
EtImhRShqUI,"18:30 ""Jesus take me now... and I'm Jewish. Oh my God!!!"" funniest line today..."
EtImhRShqUI,"Might be time to make a shirt that says ""Okay, so"""
EtImhRShqUI,"I remember when Bob Eubank said ""where is the strangest place your husband has made whoopie to you"", and the first wife was a black woman and she said "" in the butt""? ."
EtImhRShqUI,Curses a lot but I mean who doesn’t while cooking?? Im high as well so that makes 2 of us San the cooking guy??
EtImhRShqUI,"U should make a shirt with ""okay so"", but put a melting cheese as it almost sounds like ur saying Queso (Spanish for Cheese) "
EtImhRShqUI,Would be like u to do something that would be a play on words. lol
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam saying ""Yas Queen"" had me so weak I hit rewind 3 times!"
EtImhRShqUI,Only thing that needed for me is some blue cheese/feta/Gorgonzola crumble.
EtImhRShqUI,"The s in frites is silent. Amazing dish tough, clicked as soon as I saw it!"
EtImhRShqUI,"Ok, so when you say ""Waygu Beef"" you are really saying Japanese Beef Beef."
EtImhRShqUI,I’m making this right now.  I’ll let you know how it is in 30.
EtImhRShqUI,"""And heeeeere they are"""
EtImhRShqUI,And heeeere's video of it.

EtImhRShqUI,“Don’t Miss Your Chance”
EtImhRShqUI,"5:30 ""or so."""
EtImhRShqUI,"Queso?  Que, So?"
EtImhRShqUI,What watch id the big guy always wearing? Looks like it could take a beating.
EtImhRShqUI,This looks SO good
EtImhRShqUI,9:35 They do a reference to that show in the first Shrek movie when Farquaad is picking the princesses. https://youtu.be/mFl8nzZuExE (1:53) in the linked video
EtImhRShqUI,that sure is one hulk of a watch  -- what are you wearing?
EtImhRShqUI,"""And here's Johnny""?"
EtImhRShqUI,"""And now you take a fork out of your back pocket, pock around a bit"" then eat with your hands lol."
EtImhRShqUI,"I don’t mind the “Okay, so” tbh ?"
EtImhRShqUI,"Thank you!! - I live in La Réunion in the Indian ocean which is an island under French nationality, the wife and I are having friends over this Friday night and I was struggling to decide what to cook, but you have saved me! C'est parfait!"
EtImhRShqUI,"Me when I first started watching your Youtube channel: wow, there's a lot of god stuff that I can cook on my own at home!"
EtImhRShqUI,"Me now: wow, he's using way too many expensive ingredients and I can't afford to do stuff like that."
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam ""canoe of pleasure"" the cooking guy"
EtImhRShqUI,"This morning at 5am i was looking up steak fry videos and i thought to myself ""i don't see any sam the cooking guy videos on steak fries?"" Then after work 8hrs later here it is."
EtImhRShqUI,“We don’t eat with our eyes but we definitely see with them”
EtImhRShqUI,"Jeezus man, that looks frickn' delicious!"
EtImhRShqUI,"""Canoe of pleasure?""  hahahaha.  You crack me up.  But all kidding aside, OOOOO....my....gosh, this dish had me salivating!  You're the man!  Have a great weekend."
EtImhRShqUI,"9:53 Come on this was easy - ""Win a Dance with Chance!"""
EtImhRShqUI,I just found a waygu farm in Texas..... definitely trying this recipe!!
EtImhRShqUI,"Enjoyed talking to you at your new restaurant  Sam, you really rock! Thanks for taking the time to greet and talk to my family. We all enjoy your videos."
EtImhRShqUI,Best intros on YouTube ?
EtImhRShqUI,That dish looked absolutely amazing! Can't imagine what it tastes like.
EtImhRShqUI,"""And heeeeeeee they are..."" is actually the late great Jim Lange introducing the three bachelors/bachelorettes to be questioned on The Dating Game."
EtImhRShqUI,"Missed it by that much, Sam. ?"
EtImhRShqUI,As a knife lover it breaks my heart every time you cut with your knife on that metal top.
EtImhRShqUI,Has to literally SAW threw the steak with his own branded knife showcasing how dull and how little it holds an edge ...yikes
EtImhRShqUI,That dish has to be one of the most beautiful things I've seen in a very long time!
EtImhRShqUI,"""And then take your fork out of your back pocket"""
EtImhRShqUI,Is it a normal thing in the USA to keep a fork in your back pocket for whenever there's food around??
EtImhRShqUI,"Thanks Sam I'm swapping out 2 minute noodle night to this for the Family, might be more expensive but the flavour looks amazing. Would luv to see sum  mid week quick meals on the grill as we eat BBQ chicken every ways sideways  - n0mad"
EtImhRShqUI,17:36 it's like he's about to have his first kiss LOL
EtImhRShqUI,What about “ We will be back in 2 and 2”. What show from the same era?
EtImhRShqUI,All this perfect video is lacking is a '70's porn music track in the background.
EtImhRShqUI,"Just like Homer Simpson describing his local Kentucky Fried Panda, ""It was finger-ling-ling good"""
EtImhRShqUI,"Love how Sam only uses 'His' New Knife in every video. He is a marketing Genius! That being said, I can't wait to order one!"
EtImhRShqUI,"Take a shot everytime Sam says... ""OK so"""
EtImhRShqUI,“Jesus take me now...and I’m Jewish” ?
EtImhRShqUI,"“And heeeeerrrr they are”,...is from the Dating Game, NOT the Newlywed Game. Genius."
EtImhRShqUI,Have you ever cooked anything that’s was bad in taste but still film it as if it was delicious? Or is that sworn to secrecy? Lol ? btw everything always look f***ing delicious
EtImhRShqUI,I watch this channel for the food and you end up making me Laugh my *ss off. Love this channel.
EtImhRShqUI,"Man, there too much at STEAK here, I don't want to make my normal bad dad jokes... I'd probably start a beef. And besides, I don't want to get FRIED! ?"
EtImhRShqUI,“And here they are” is outta Shrek when the mirror is showing the princesses.
EtImhRShqUI,Bob Eubanks: where is the strangest place that you've made Whoopi?
EtImhRShqUI,"Contestant: In da butt, Bob"
EtImhRShqUI,Whenever Sam takes a bite any of his food now 
EtImhRShqUI,all I can think about is those two Australian contest 
EtImhRShqUI,winners a few weeks ago. When he gave them bites 
EtImhRShqUI,"of what he was cooking, they were both comically"
EtImhRShqUI,"So steak frites, is French for steak fries?  But we have steak fries.  Those are the larger sized fries, almost like potato wedges.  So, shouldn't it be ""steak with fries""?  Or are the French just too lazy to add the ""with""."
EtImhRShqUI,"Fritesss lol, its ""des frites"" (don't pronounce the ""s""), and it are baked patato's, but looks delicious."
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam ""ok so"" is totally fine.  At least its not like my boss that says ""anyhoo"" like every 3 words in a sentance. Keep doing what you do."
EtImhRShqUI,Max upgrading his editing skills!
EtImhRShqUI,Kudos!
EtImhRShqUI,"Gonna try it in the weekend, but I've never heard of or seen finger potatoes, gonna use regular ones."
EtImhRShqUI,"""Ok so"" buy my food related merch..."
EtImhRShqUI,stop calling every beef wagyu beef if it's not the authentic japansese stuff it's not wagyu beef
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam, I have to say that this needs béarnaise sauce and not butter sauce my friend!! Being from Belgium that is the best recommendation I can make. Oh and don’t forget a good beer!"
EtImhRShqUI,"You just made ""brassói aprópecsenye"" (roast a la Brasov) out of wagyu beef, instead of pork"
EtImhRShqUI,"Hey bro, “And here they are” was from the Dating Game, bro. Got it, bro? Okay, bro. Not The Newlywed Game, bro."
EtImhRShqUI,Sam- that line is from THE DATING GAME
EtImhRShqUI,Who else took the escalator down to the comment section?!?!?!
EtImhRShqUI,I've learned/retained so much from watching your videos without even realizing it! 
EtImhRShqUI,"Whenever I cook now; I hear a voice in the back of my head ""Aaaaaand we mix!"""
EtImhRShqUI,In all technicality when we observe the perfect and beauty of our meals we truly are eating with our eyes. Very few people are actually willing to eat something that doesn’t look appealing to them in any way
EtImhRShqUI,Where do I find the specific measurements on the ingredients? (specifically herbs and spices lol)
EtImhRShqUI,Sam cracks me up!  He freaking rocks!
EtImhRShqUI,"And I really want to cook this now, so I’m headed to the grocery store"
EtImhRShqUI,NICE
EtImhRShqUI,Did u say “queso” for cheese ? in Spanish or
EtImhRShqUI,Okay ? so? 
EtImhRShqUI,That’s be a nice shirt
EtImhRShqUI,Queso or okay so
EtImhRShqUI,"This is youtube, I'm guessing maybe a fraction of your viewers have any idea what the heck you're on about at 9:20 ish"
EtImhRShqUI,This is great every time I watch it videos I wanna cook ur food while I watch it. Best thing ever I always end up having all the ingredients to make.. it's always tastes soo good.
EtImhRShqUI,"The answer for your newly wed game question you started to ask is ""that would be in the butt Bob"" that question and answer will be remembered for ever."
EtImhRShqUI,"Hey Sam love your channel cook your recipes for my family almost every night. Just one ask, can you cook more side dishes or maybe include them on your other recipes. It would help a lot in the way of family meal planning. Thanks ?"
EtImhRShqUI,"Frites, place on baking sheet  ""face down"" on ""flat part"" . Sam, it's called CUT SIDE DOWN and i love you anyway and I bought a shirt."
EtImhRShqUI,"I feel like I'm getting cooking lessons from the original Sam Fisher, almost identical voice"
EtImhRShqUI,"Hey! You got your knife back.?   ""so it's gonna be just two more things, kosher salt and pepper, and a little garlic powder""?"
EtImhRShqUI,"We don’t eat with our eyes, we see with them ? I had it wrong all these years....."
EtImhRShqUI,It’s awesome how this channel is growing!! I remember when you cooked inside lol.
EtImhRShqUI,2 words: Looks amazing!!
EtImhRShqUI,Hey Sam...I just got done binge-watching a bunch of your videos. Introduced my Mom to your channel. I even went down to NotNot Tacos for lunch the other day for the first time. It was excellent!! I was hoping to see if you could do Ossobuco sometime soon? Have a great week and I absolutely love your channel!!
EtImhRShqUI,"YAAS Queen ?? I remember the dating game . Bob Eubanks would say ,who is your choice "" no #1 ,2 , or 3 . ""Let's she who Susan didn't choose behind door  number one or three ?? The steak and frites look amazing Omg !! ?"
EtImhRShqUI,The creativity is back after a couple of average dishes! Love it!
EtImhRShqUI,No one:
EtImhRShqUI,Sam moaning while eating
EtImhRShqUI,"SAM!  I love you man, but I can't take anything you say seriously anymore, when everything you make apparently brings you to climax."
EtImhRShqUI,Me watching this while air frying a hot Pocket:       Ah delicious
EtImhRShqUI,That grill pan! Getting one of those immediately! Also this may be your best video ever. #ChanceNation
EtImhRShqUI,Really starting to dig Max’s editorial text inserts. LOL
EtImhRShqUI,It was at this moment 17:48 when I thought Sam went into cardiac arrest from all that damn grease. ???
EtImhRShqUI,Lol I almost had a religious moment just watching you take that full bite!
EtImhRShqUI,Also from Shrek! The magic mirror!! Sounds exactly like that!
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam my homie! I love your love of food,your willingness to make "" traditional recipes"" with your twist and absorb the hate from the tradidionalists. I consider myself a good cook but you have made me try things that are now a staple to  my cooking. I am a big outdoorsman and cook a lot of wild game/fish. Just a request not a demand please do a wild game recipe.Ever eaten elk? I used an elk neckbone  using your braised rib recipe! It was organically fantastic. Been a fan for a long time, I tell my wife if we're ever in sandiego we're going to Not Not tacos. My son is 12 and he's always busting my balls about how I fillet walleye or butcher an elk or deer,like he knows wtf he's talking about,he's a "
EtImhRShqUI,"just started watching your channel, asking myself why tf it took this long! great content"
EtImhRShqUI,would be great if at the end you also add tasting by the team and their reactions ;)
EtImhRShqUI,Have you ever been told you remind me of the clear eyes commercial guy..
EtImhRShqUI,Also can’t wait to get my knife!
EtImhRShqUI,I come here for Max's editing as much as Sam's non-sense show
EtImhRShqUI,"time to make some "" Oh, queso"" dip."
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam pulled back at the last minute.  That's what she said!  Yes, I'm 5 or the manager of a very mediocre paper company.  :-)"
EtImhRShqUI,"Ok so is fine! All the cut away, replays, thats enough of that!"
EtImhRShqUI,And awayyyy we go!

EtImhRShqUI,"Sam I love your content and you’ve helped me cook many dishes. My one ask if you is to restock or bring in new tote bags. As you may be aware, many states are currently banning plastic grocery bags and/or charging for the paper ones. This is in an attempt to be more environmentally friendly. In response many people began recently using reusable tote bags (myself included) . I’d love to support the channel and having a grocery bag from MACA would be a ton of fun, I’ve noticed a lot of your styles are sold out (particularly the make America cook ones with the peace logo) please consider refereeing your stores tote bag options as many states begin forcing us to use totes. I want stylish totes not ones with the grocery stores name on them because they sold them there"

EtImhRShqUI,"I remember the questions on the Newlywed Show about  ""Making Whoopie""..  That's as racy as they were allowed to get.  You are not alone.  I'm not quite a boomer, but I still remember the show."
EtImhRShqUI,His hands already do be lookin like those potatoes boi
EtImhRShqUI,Make some Salchipapas for the latinos!
EtImhRShqUI,before i even get to the end of the video. i hear you say the streak will take 3 min to cook. Gonna be RAW as SHIET like usual. Man i wish u cooked medium rare/medium. Its the best.
EtImhRShqUI,Wagyu is really delicious. could eat it as a snack. It is rather expensive however. Which makes sense considering the quality. I've heard people call it the australian kobe. ;P
EtImhRShqUI,DEEP FRY SAM YOU KNOW IT DO IT GUY! LUV YA
EtImhRShqUI,recipes on website not up to date. you should post the recipe in the description
EtImhRShqUI,Did you put salt on the steak before cooking it? You didn’t show any prep for the steak :/
EtImhRShqUI,Damn that looks good ?
EtImhRShqUI,am i the only one really hoping this date with chance thing is actually happening ?

EtImhRShqUI,"Name change, Sam the Que'so Guy!"
EtImhRShqUI,What ever happened to Lynn? Why did he leave the show?
EtImhRShqUI,I tried it last night. Next time I’ll make in the sauce with less butter and in the last five minutes while I cook the steak.  I started after I flipped the potatoes and overcooked it.
EtImhRShqUI,Anyone else start liking the video based solely on the thumbnail?
EtImhRShqUI,"Sam. Like your channel, love your vids because you stay yourself. However I got an issue. You could have done a little more research on this dish. It’s not french. Steak frites ( written in french) or steak friet( written in flemish) is a Belgian invention and actually it is 1 of our national dishes overall. Flemish and french are both spoken languages in Belgium hence the Flemish and french spelling. But the damn thing is Belgian. Other than that loving your version on it though."
EtImhRShqUI,"just saying ""FRITES"" are Fries"
EtImhRShqUI,salt pepper and garlic powder? someones been watching gugafoods :P
EtImhRShqUI,"You know Sam I ain’t gay, but I’d still go on a date with Chance if you’d cook for us....?"

EtImhRShqUI,Win a chance with Chance at romance.

QOQdsewdGTs,that limp soggy pizza really ain't it
QOQdsewdGTs,"tip for the last recipe!!! do NOT add the chicken before cooking the pasta!!! it’s going to turn out to be EXTREMELY tough and over cooked. either fully cook the chicken in the beginning and add it at the end after the pasta is cooked, or particularly cook it and add it just before the pasta is cooked to ensure tender chicken"
QOQdsewdGTs,yo this legit makes me so mad??? why'd you add yeast if ur not gonna let that dough rise.... i feel attacked
QOQdsewdGTs,Easy cheesy Mac’n cheese
QOQdsewdGTs,"Me: HMM yes,the floor here is made out of floor"

QOQdsewdGTs,"omg worst background music ever,so annoying"

QOQdsewdGTs,"Is it just me or does anybody watch cooking videos that teach you how to cook, but never actually makes them.. ?"

QOQdsewdGTs,1:34 lets be honest. We all just eat mac n cheese out of a pan?
QOQdsewdGTs,The pizza that came out the pan is different from the pizza that is sliced look at the peporoni count
QOQdsewdGTs,This should be “how to ruin meals with parsley” ?
QOQdsewdGTs,"Does the yeast actually do anything in that pizza crust?  I mean, without time for it to activate and multiply - does it actually have the ability to contribute anything?"

QOQdsewdGTs,That limpy soggy pizza is the saddest thing I've ever seen. You might as well use a large corn / flour tortilla as the base which will probably taste better as well with a better crunch (and it will have far fewer calories than that sad ass dough)
QOQdsewdGTs,wow

QOQdsewdGTs,"I'm kinda late but when you start cooking you need to learn basics not just ingrediënts and shit you need to learn to cut things and how to cut things, for example: Onions, you can dice them, but you can cut halve rings out of them, it looks easy until you begin."

QOQdsewdGTs,I tried making the pizza and because they didn't specify the temperature my doe went black and stuck to the pan wouldn't recommend any recipes from tasty even though they look good and easy.
QOQdsewdGTs,There is no point in putting yeast in that Pizza recipe since you basically don't allow enough time for the yeast to do it's thing.
QOQdsewdGTs,It looks delicious with pepperoni pizza and pasta. I enjoyed the four dishes.

QOQdsewdGTs,             .... sniff sniff
QOQdsewdGTs,"Trained cook here. These recipes are actually quite difficult, seeing that the pizza demands some spreading-accuracy (yes that is a thing) and cooking pasta in milk/cream requires attention and some knowledge on when stuff burns to the bottom and why. I would honestly recommend starting with carbonara, the non-authentic version that is."

QOQdsewdGTs,"Good lord you brought the pizza recipe of sadness back. This is what makes me want to unsubscribe. Not because I'm particularly offended by it, but because it genuinely makes me suspect that you don't understand how to make good food. Buzzfeed/Tasty did a perfectly fine cast-iron pizza ""hack"" recipe a while back, couldn't you have just recycled that instead of reminding us of this flat floppy mess?"

RCxpqotKE2s,No matter how strong the glass of your preserves if the internal temperature is hot & you cool the external bottle too quickly it will explode in your hands so melting chocolate like that is very dangerous. Just use your microwave with a microwave safe dish.

oIK8UzNuCTY,I use the white of the egg in my binding. The york smells i never use it i throw it out.
oIK8UzNuCTY,Those patties probably taste great thanks
oIK8UzNuCTY,"I made this recipe when i first found it with a slight modification (used a more shallow layer of EVCO and used my oven) and with more variations since then - sometimes added peas, other spice (powdered lemon juice, dijon mustard, small black lentis, etc - one ingredient swap, not all at once ?)  Regardless, the patties were delicious and (to me) tasted equally good at room temp. I stuff a pita with these and a bit of pickled red cabbage slaw and a touch of garlic aioli. They hold shape very well, so could be made using those adorable cookie molds (like planes, stars, fish, etc) for picky eater kiddos.  Thamks for the recipe!"
oIK8UzNuCTY,looks yummy   thank yo so much

8-2a3al8pm0,Copying a recipe is not a survival skill! Neither is city girls shooting in a village setting.
8-2a3al8pm0,They prepared a location to properly prepare the animal. They also dressed the animal and prepared it responsibly. Following proven method is showing intelligence on their part. Why would they reinvent the wheel. What's you problem? Jealous much? Where's your video? No need to tell me. I'm not interested because your energy is bogus and suspect. ?

zNDPubOcXkI,Sam the cooking guy beginning of 2020: We will be cooking more healthy meals! 
zNDPubOcXkI,Sam the cooking guy three months into 2020:
zNDPubOcXkI,"Me: ""Oh wow theres actually a reasonable amount of food on this burrito."""
zNDPubOcXkI,"Sam: ""Then we just build the top side the same way we did the bottom""..."
zNDPubOcXkI,“God I hope this is big enough.” - that’s what she said
zNDPubOcXkI,With years of cooking experience youd think the chef would know that anything hot off the stove would be too hot to put directly in your mouth ?
zNDPubOcXkI,"Sam: ""Let's start eating healthier"""
zNDPubOcXkI,Also Sam: Wrap that shit in cheese
zNDPubOcXkI,As soon as I get the notification I know it's time for:
zNDPubOcXkI,1.  Massive bong hits
zNDPubOcXkI,There's actually some guy in California that's been doing these for years.
zNDPubOcXkI,"Much to the joy of his many fans, Sam still does all his own stunts"
zNDPubOcXkI,"Parents: Hey son, we're going to chipole to grab a burrito "
zNDPubOcXkI,Me: I'm just gonna chill and make myself what I call a Sam cooked burrito
zNDPubOcXkI,"I know this may sound silly, but could you do a video about how you clean certain utensils? Like that ""cil-pat"" or the knives or certain different pans - what do I do with a Wok? - what do you use to keep wood chopping boards clean, etc.etc.etc."
zNDPubOcXkI,Love the video! Take care! :)
zNDPubOcXkI,I can binge watch you all day.  And your smart ass comments are hilarious.
zNDPubOcXkI,Why is this under the “easy dinner recipes” playlist
zNDPubOcXkI,"We need a t-shirt that says ""Astro!!"" for the times Sam yells at the neighbor's dog to STFU. ?"
zNDPubOcXkI,“Lowkey burritos” give him credit tf
zNDPubOcXkI,"knife manufacturer: hey sam, just wanted to let you know the nikiri is done, it amazing. wondering how many you wanted to test...20? 30? "
zNDPubOcXkI,Sam: ummmm....1
zNDPubOcXkI,"Hey Max, "
zNDPubOcXkI,Maybe a large glass of ice water just outside of Sam's reach would add a little more drama to when Same puts smoking hot food in his mouth!
zNDPubOcXkI,"Sam, where the onions, Sam?!?!?!? LOL"
zNDPubOcXkI,This looks amazing!
zNDPubOcXkI,"""It would have been a sausage meeting point in the middle..."""
zNDPubOcXkI,My doctor said my cholesterol was high so he prescribed  blocking Sam's burrito videos lmao!
zNDPubOcXkI,Looks amazing. Next time try some Hot Picante!! It’s amazing in them! Don’t kill me in the next episode for asking you to add something lol! See you Friday!
zNDPubOcXkI,"PLEASE do Steamed Pork Dumplings. Maybe some Egg rolls, or Crab Rangoon? I want to see how you will tweak it to make it your own while also creating something that is extremely familiar! <3"
zNDPubOcXkI,"Sam and Max.... Be very clear, it is all about the GIRTH!!! :-)  Hey... just ordered my STCG knife and I am gonna chop the SHIT out of stuff!!! Can't even wait!!  xoxo Love you guys!!  Gina"
zNDPubOcXkI,For once I'm with Max. I'm 5 too cause I laughed!
zNDPubOcXkI,"You need to sell a T-shirt with the single declarative ""ASTRO!"" on it."
zNDPubOcXkI,There’s a man in DTLA that makes these. One of the tastiest things I’ve ever tried.
zNDPubOcXkI,Edit: https://www.yelp.com/biz/lowkey-burrito-los-angeles-2 there’s the link for anyone who’s in the LA area that wants to try it.
zNDPubOcXkI,"Actually, this is the knife I was kind of hoping you were going to sell."
zNDPubOcXkI,Wild hair up his ass was correct according to the way I've always heard it...
zNDPubOcXkI,Can we get a shirt that says:
zNDPubOcXkI,“ASTRO!”
zNDPubOcXkI,-Sam the Cooking Guy
zNDPubOcXkI,"You’ve outdone yourself, Sam. Brilliant idea."
zNDPubOcXkI,"""...you've got a different thing."""
zNDPubOcXkI,yeah clogged arteries is what you've got lul
zNDPubOcXkI,This is how my favorite breakfast place makes their hash browns...I actually just go there for the hash browns lol mmmm ?
zNDPubOcXkI,It’s a wonder that Sam can even taste anything. His taste buds must be so destroyed after eating so much hot stuff
zNDPubOcXkI,It's so wrong that it's right.
zNDPubOcXkI,Sam- “God I hope this is big enough” 
zNDPubOcXkI,Me waiting for max to redeem himself. “What she said”
zNDPubOcXkI,"I love your instructions while shredding a potato ??? ""Turn! Point!"""
zNDPubOcXkI,Doctor: Why do I see cheese crust around your heart?
zNDPubOcXkI,Me: forwards this video
zNDPubOcXkI,I love that Sam burns his mouth almost every episode. Always cracks me up.
zNDPubOcXkI,sam: the cooking guy
zNDPubOcXkI,max: the camera guy
zNDPubOcXkI,"We need a #MaxAppreciationDay. I love his contributions to the show. There was serious chortling at the SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON, etc. over Sam trying to describe the CHEESE FORWARD brekkie burrito."
zNDPubOcXkI,Sam is clearly trying to kill me! In a good way ?

zNDPubOcXkI,"Sam: amazing creations, wit, entertainment & life lessons"
zNDPubOcXkI,"Max: let’s be douchy bandwagoners & use “SMASH that subscribe button” like the YT geniuses influence us to; next maybe we can bring back the EVOO to Flavortown & really kick it up a notch to the next level, that’d be totally tubular!"
zNDPubOcXkI,im pretty sure every person watching knew you were gonna burn the shit outta your mouth biting that sausage lmao

r2vk4B5-8Bs,I made number 10 and it was so good! I should come to these videos more often for meal ideas
r2vk4B5-8Bs,"@ Tasty: What an excellent video montage of great recipes and you were doing so well until the very last one darn it! You NEVER NEVER EVER use Enchilada sauce for Chicken Tortilla soup!!! I've seen this mistake repeated so many times in online recipes (such as Chicken Tortilla Soup or Menudo) and it betrays the non-Hispanic identity of the person who wrote it lol!! Enchilada sauce has a VERY distinctive flavor & was created strictly for the single purpose of making Enchiladas. Don't ever use it for soups or else it will make your dish taste like Enchilada soup, lol. Instead I recommend adding 1 diced jalepeno, some fire roasted tomatoes, and at least 1-2 7oz cans of Salsa Casera (more will not be a bad thing hint hint lol) to give it a more correct & accurate flavor. Glad to see you did add lime juice & cilantro at the end though, nice touch."

coK5wE7DSV0,When you have none of these ingredients but you still watch these videos....
coK5wE7DSV0,Idk why i watch these as of I’ll ever actually make them
coK5wE7DSV0,Is it just me sitting in bed just watching these knowing imma never gonna make it and just making myself hungry
coK5wE7DSV0,why does all their food look so good. ITS SORCERY!!
coK5wE7DSV0,If you see my comment..I hope your dreams come true.?
coK5wE7DSV0,"Ahhh, time to play the 'how many Tasty videos can i watch in bed until I'm starving' game"
coK5wE7DSV0,This fast food would take most people a very long time to make....
coK5wE7DSV0,Fast food- let it rest for 1 hour. 
coK5wE7DSV0,"Yeah sure, let me call Domino's Pizza real quick"
coK5wE7DSV0,I’ve found a simpler way of making all of these
coK5wE7DSV0,Step1: Get in your car
coK5wE7DSV0,Step2: Buy fast food cause it’s cheaper than getting all these ingredients
coK5wE7DSV0,That is one bland pizza! Where’s the rest of the cheese? Any other toppings? SOMEthing more than sauce and a little bit of Parmesan?
coK5wE7DSV0,Me : OH I'll make this!
coK5wE7DSV0,Also me: looks through kitchen and only finding salt and pepper
coK5wE7DSV0,Me again: screw it.

coK5wE7DSV0,the amount of times you have posted the same video of the wings...
coK5wE7DSV0,"Oh look, it’s the wings recipe from 2 days ago. Who would have thought they had something original?"
coK5wE7DSV0,Why do I always watch these videos with an empty stomach
coK5wE7DSV0,Sigh it's probably fast for them but slow for me lol ???
coK5wE7DSV0,"when he put the butter and onions in the pot i was like ""dam that looks good"""
coK5wE7DSV0,"A very important notice to tasty viewers: I have tried a lot of recepies from tasty and I have noticed a general thing . They are not the best tasting dishes ! Pretty ironic ryt? Well, not everything that looks good should taste good."
coK5wE7DSV0,I need to stop coming to this channel while stoned...
coK5wE7DSV0,Well every time i eat those dishes 
coK5wE7DSV0,MY TUMMY FELL NICE
coK5wE7DSV0,BUT AFTERWARDS 
coK5wE7DSV0,im literally on a diet where i cant eat anything here still watching tho
coK5wE7DSV0,"1:46 ""The best crispy buffalo wings"" I don't see why Tasty producers would cut that out since we all know these vids are recycled."
coK5wE7DSV0,Hey Tasty..I ?This..Have you ever seen a cake made from off the charcoal grill? I DID?
coK5wE7DSV0,"I watch these vids 24/7, even when I know I'm not going to make anything except if microwave meals."
coK5wE7DSV0,Tasty picks really great music. Love it.
coK5wE7DSV0,"Being honest i tried commenting first so i could get subscribes, as told by many YouTubes but failed ???"
coK5wE7DSV0,I’m gonna add a emoji every time someone likes this post starting with mine
coK5wE7DSV0,??
coK5wE7DSV0,Moment when you're a junior in high school and you could edit this shit together better than them
coK5wE7DSV0,"The pizza though - I use that 2 ingredient recipe for the dough and whip up a pizza in about 30 minutes total. Don't know if it would work for a deep pan style, but worth a shot ? other than that, the rest seem like a lot of work for ""fast"" food ?"
coK5wE7DSV0,never been this early (uploaded 3 minutes ago)
coK5wE7DSV0,I watched the first time for the food but saved it as my favorites for the MUSIC. Whats the name of the track?
coK5wE7DSV0,Ya know what’s funny...I saw all of these on the channel and already made them (vEgAn oF cOuRsE)
coK5wE7DSV0,2:42 I never knew buffaloes had wings...
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Its good to see that they actually toasted the he hamburger bun. Thank you
JNm2Gs3zucQ,When making fried chicken. 
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Thank you for making this video I'm not quite sure why people are leaving such negative comments if they don't like they can simple stop watching.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"I'd been frying and baking tilapia for years to where I didn't like the taste of it anymore. So I bought some Swai. I'd never done it before so I watched this video. It was tremendously helpful. I washed and inspected the fish then dried it off. Salt and peppered it. Created my own marinade, breaded with my own blend of breading then seared it in the pan on both side. Then I placed it in the oven. It was delicious! My family liked it a lot. :) The only thing I did different was that I didn't use my hands to press in the seasonings. I used a fork. Thank you for the tutorial. It really helped."
JNm2Gs3zucQ,I tried swai and enjoyed it very much. Thank you.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Just cook the thing already haaa
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"Thank you so much, Debra  for your feedback :) Yes Jason knows how to cook )) I will try to film something else  from his crazy cooking :))  "
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Great video!  I've never had much luck cooking fish but this looks like it will work well for me!  Thank you!
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"great video, I did a copycat video of this although I tweaked it just a bit. thanks for sharing "
JNm2Gs3zucQ, 
JNm2Gs3zucQ,I'd starve to death waiting on this guy to cook food. So he adds more salt with sea salt and the garlic salt has salt in it. My goodness alive! Would you like a little fish with your salt?
JNm2Gs3zucQ,I think it needs more spice! 
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"excellent, good demo; I tried it had two left in the freezer. The recipe was new to me and I did everything except I use a long pyrex instead. It tasted fabulous, thanks. I will buy more Swai just to do this recipe!"
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Have you looked up swai?
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Great Video  Fish Looks  so yummy thank You:)
JNm2Gs3zucQ,This was hard to watch
JNm2Gs3zucQ,how did you like the fish with your spices?
JNm2Gs3zucQ,I added all the ingredients you did minus the bread crumbs and fried them in coconut oils and it was fabulous... thank you so much...
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Can you make swai fish and chips I would like to see that
JNm2Gs3zucQ,How much time on each side in the pan?
JNm2Gs3zucQ,That is so yummy thx
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Great vid
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Great video
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Looks as good as a fish you would get at a fine restaurant.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,All the spices you used up to the dill are exactly what we do to our fish before frying it in India. Instead of the dill we use cumin powder. We then dredge the fish in bread crumbs and shallow fry. Swai is my favorite fish. Fortunately for me swai nuggets have become really cheap at Walmart.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Have made plenty of swai and like it it's different and really filling but not a heavy filling like steak would be. Give it a try and if it's not raw don't worry about anything...if steak was raw you'd have to worry about parasites anyways. Silly people. I'll give your rub a try!
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"I made swai once and it was so slimy and mushy I hated it and never made it again. Now that I read about parasites and such, I really don't want to eat it!"
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"you have too many spices  that mask the flavor of the fish!!! swai has a great flavor with olive oil and old bay, that's all you need there chubby lumpkins!!"
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Great video. I hope you threw out those spices you contaminated!
JNm2Gs3zucQ,OMG I think I'm scared  to cook my swai fish tonight... It's my 1st time and don't wanna get my family sick OMG 
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"I always buy Tilapia from Kroger. I wanted to try something new, so I bought this Swai fish for the first time 3 days ago. Today I was frying the fish when I found two parasites. I do not want to try this anymore. I stick to the Tilapia. I searched the net and I found out Swai and Basa have the risk of food poisoning due to chemicals or parasites. Apparently there is a cat fish war between the American and Vietnamese producers, so you may find pros and cons info on the net, but I saw the parasites with my own eyes before searching about it. So please be really careful if you are going to cook this fish."
JNm2Gs3zucQ,"ever watch a food show , add the spices, list them, this is sooooooo boring, are you for real? ever think of washing hands and poring spice in a small bowl all your spices are now contaminated. glad your not cooking for me, really!"
JNm2Gs3zucQ,I roll it in cornmeal and fry it like catfish.We like it better not fishy tasting.about half the price of catfish.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,what the price per kilo of swai?
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Worse tasting fish I ever had.  I ate one quarter of a fillet and dump the rest in the garbage.
JNm2Gs3zucQ,Wtf horrible

vyTC2IxhCZM,"Wow and they don't look a day older than 19.... seriously, I love their show...unlike the Food Network, who has gone rogue and everything is a game show (cooking is my relaxing therapy...I do not need an adrenaline rush) they have remained a true instructional cooking show and I have learned so much ..I also appreciate their product and food reviews!   Congratulations on your success!"
vyTC2IxhCZM,"PBS has been inspiring me to cook from an early age for over 40 years, and ATK has been a big part for about half of that. Your cookbook has become a regular go-to, as have your videos. You are a great inspiration to many, of that I am certain. (Yes, even you, Dan. ?) Here's to many more generations of cooks and chefs inspired by you and other PBS programming. ???"
vyTC2IxhCZM,"I've been watching ATK for years, own several DVDs and cookbooks, and have bought several recommended pieces of equipment. I took 3 years of Home Economics between middle and high school, which gave me a basic cooking education, but ATK gave me my passion and has made a better cook over the years. It's the chefs, prep cooks, kitchen staff, and the recording & editing crew plus the social media staff that makes ATK what it is: THE best cooking out there. I can't wait to see the 20th anniversary episode. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, AMERICA'S TEST KITCHEN!!!"
vyTC2IxhCZM,Congrats..... please continue for another 20!
vyTC2IxhCZM,congrats! you taught me how to cook. Thank you!

vyTC2IxhCZM,"I've been with America's Test Kitchen since before there was a show, going all the way back to 'Cook's Magazine' and then 'Cook's Illustrated.' I still get the magazine, and now I'm also a Multi-Site subscriber to CoolsIllustratedMagazine.com, AmericasTestKitchen.com, and CooksCountry.com. I've developed a habit of logging in and going to the equipment reviews before buying any kitchen gadgets or small appliances, and I go to the taste tests when making up my shopping lists. The latter is especially helpful since the site often updates recommendations when companies change the formulations of their products."
vyTC2IxhCZM,Thank you

vyTC2IxhCZM,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. My best friend Dan (he doesn't know that, yet) didn't tell me that we were supposed to submit videos of our Test Kitchen recipe shenanigans. I have weeks of Twitch streams praising my new best friend Dan's (again, doesn't know yet), Brussels Sprouts, preaching his What's Eating Dan episode that made Brussels Sprouts awesome. I feel a little left out. I thought me and best friend Dan had a better friendship than this."

vyTC2IxhCZM,I love America's Test Kitchen
vyTC2IxhCZM,I think Dan is sexy

vyTC2IxhCZM,I agree also. The best is yet to come.
vyTC2IxhCZM,"Butts were wood barrels that they shipped in to boston , anywhere from 30-50 pounnds of salt cured hams and shoulders were shipped in these butts, sometimes with extra salt. It has nothing to do with the butt of a hog/pig, lol. This was standard from the 1700's to 1800's, you can check your history books or google these days, but i'm giving you info from a 56 yr. old hillbilly from rural kentucky. I have 2 of the 30 's butts, one on each side of the front door. They are made with staves, just like a regular wood barrel , love your show"

vyTC2IxhCZM,Bridgett is looking better and better!
vyTC2IxhCZM,"I hate to say it, because I liked him, but everyone on the show seems so much happier with Chris gone. His presence seemed to crank everyone’s anxiety up a notch, and it was palpable. My guess is he didn’t play well with others. ATK is doing just fine without him. Just my take..."

IfA170UHjBE,I'm so happy to find you. I like the way you explains and make it very easy to understanding. keep going boy.  Thanks so much
IfA170UHjBE,I feel like people would watch a 3 hour live stream of you cooking ?

IfA170UHjBE,Is olive oil ok to use when cutting ?
IfA170UHjBE,Try thawing out meats before u start anything else. So by the time you need them they are soft.
IfA170UHjBE,"Awesome video, the voice over great!"
IfA170UHjBE,Great job! Loved the video.

IfA170UHjBE,Another awesome meal prep video! You make it look so easy! ...hey do you ever re-use those  pans? They always seem new...but I would assume you could use maybe your broccoli pans over or something?
IfA170UHjBE,I find your channel so helpful on how different me and my partner should be eating :) thanks for including a girls one in the video too. I always know how much I should be eating but figuring it out for him is hard

IfA170UHjBE,I like your video but i need swtich the volume constantly because the music too loud
IfA170UHjBE,"I want to do this, but wonder how long it lasts in the fridge!"
IfA170UHjBE,"I really love the meal prep you do for your sister , I wish I had a brother like you?.

I eat 5 times a day three meals  and two snacks..can you please help me the struggle is real...lol"
IfA170UHjBE,"Yes, I definitely multitask sometimes while watching. The grind is real. The voiceover definitely helped. "
IfA170UHjBE,Lol! Film protector. I would have left it on though. 
IfA170UHjBE,Stellar video! Loved it. I liked your cooking methods for the chicken and fries; and that you mixed the lettuces. Great combination of voice over and music. You are a great buddy and brother!

IfA170UHjBE,"Here for the meal prep, and his smile"
IfA170UHjBE,Needed this. I’m prepping for myself and my husband which is hard and our kids. Glad I’m not the only one doing so many. Also your personality reminds me of my husband.
IfA170UHjBE,The voice over is working in terms of better comprehension. 
IfA170UHjBE,Yes. snacks.
IfA170UHjBE,I really like that I-talian medley.
IfA170UHjBE,I stumbled up on your videos about 2wks ago while surfing youtube and been tuned in ever since.. I also would like to know if you could include workouts and eating days for women.. Ive been following your lower calorie cutting meal prep plans so far..
IfA170UHjBE,"Say you cook 20 meals, how long does it usually take you to finish"
IfA170UHjBE,How do you not have a million subscribers yet? I don't understand society ?... Keep up the great work!
IfA170UHjBE,Omg you make it look so easy but what a great heart u have for cooking and videoing all same time pat on the back for you now one day I'll be as great as you Thanks for the ideal meals now it's my turn yikes wish me luck ??
IfA170UHjBE,Your hairstyle tho! :)
IfA170UHjBE,Awesome prep video. Love that you do both male a female portions.
IfA170UHjBE,I really enjoy these videos. U do a great job.
IfA170UHjBE,God bless you from pakistan
IfA170UHjBE,What kind of dressing do you put on your salad?
IfA170UHjBE,"Looks good, im going to try to bake my sweet potatoes into wedges this weekend for next week prep cause im kinda tired eating boiled sweet potatoes. Ive watched your videos from  prepping for one person to three person now. Who knows one day you might prep meals for tons of customers for a small fee."
IfA170UHjBE,how do you count the macros on the oil?
IfA170UHjBE,Love the video bro! Did your barber/stylist cut a little too much from the right side of your head?
IfA170UHjBE,You make prepping look easy.  I'm going to meal prep today.
IfA170UHjBE,He looks like Frank Mir
IfA170UHjBE,"Great video, but the music was SO BAD!"
IfA170UHjBE,"Awesome channel man. Really helpful meal prep tips. Also, you are the only Youtuber I know that attempts to respond to every comment. Hard work pays off. Keep on keeping on!"
IfA170UHjBE,Always love your videos. I'd say I prefer this style the best. Especially since I like to listen more than watch when I'm actually cooking.  I appreciate you taking the time to do this lol now if I could only convince you to meal prep for me ? I second whoever suggested creating your own meal prep service!
IfA170UHjBE,Can you share a link for the rice cooker you use please?
IfA170UHjBE,"can YOU meal prep , MEALS that can be frozen ; like a tv dinner. I want to fill MY freezer with dinners and lunches and some breakfasts"
IfA170UHjBE,Hey man. I was wondering what are the specific macros and sodium on the salmon for 1 serving size?
IfA170UHjBE,Where are your pans from? Trying to find good ones online. Btw thank you again for great videos! :)
IfA170UHjBE,"Hi there. Could you please please tell me how you carry those 3 compartments food containers around? Because I really want to buy them, but they don't fit into my regular size backpack... And I'm always on the go"
IfA170UHjBE,So you are having 5 of those meals per day?
IfA170UHjBE,How long did it take you?
IfA170UHjBE,I'm going to try seasoning my sweet potatoes the way you do.
IfA170UHjBE,Lol been there. The one thing about meal prep is it takes a few hours. I'm trying to figure out ways to cut down the cooking time. So far I buy pre chopped veggies when possible and i batch my protein cooking into a single 1.5 hour round (chicken and veg). Rice and lentils take less time to cook but should be done early so you dont wait as long for them to cool down.
IfA170UHjBE,"Your wife or girlfriend will be so lucky to have you,never seen a man being so precise and neat with cooking ,not just for himself but also for others....BRAVO"
IfA170UHjBE,Last sosege from the binging looks like a pines with condom
IfA170UHjBE,"Your videos are great, but your personality is even better, so down to earth. Great job!"
IfA170UHjBE,How well does the salmon keep in the fridge through the week?
IfA170UHjBE,"Hi great vid man,um do you put them in the freezer or fridge and how to reheat them best ?"
IfA170UHjBE,great video!!!
IfA170UHjBE,"Awesome vid brother! I'll be passing through your way Saturday and Sunday, going to see the fiancèe. We should meet up real quick sometime, that way I can post on my site about your channel--even though I am already going to shout you out and show some of your vids on my blog posts! (Sorry, not trying to come across as creepy or some shit. Definitely not a serial killer ?)."
IfA170UHjBE,Dam bruh... they better pay u extra for all that food plus they messing with ur sleep gains...
IfA170UHjBE,I like the voiceover! I also like the way you cut up your veggies- you include the white part (which is the best part in my opinion). I always enjoy watching your videos. I can't wait for your next vlog :D
IfA170UHjBE,How did your sweet potatoes fries came out ?  I done it once and it was all soggy and burnt . Any suggestions :] ? Thanks 
IfA170UHjBE,And what is the nutritional facts for the salmon ? I enjoy your meal prepping !
IfA170UHjBE,On an Eco note:  Do you reuse the foil pans or the portioning dishes?  Seems like it could get expensive if you don't.
IfA170UHjBE,"really great video quality, but you should definitely get a better microphone with less background noise :)"
IfA170UHjBE,would love to see a meal plan video on PCOS food. about 1 in 10 women suffer from it.
IfA170UHjBE,What is the brand of your scale?
IfA170UHjBE,Solid prep
IfA170UHjBE,You are awesome
IfA170UHjBE,"You could start up  a business being a meal prepper.liscence,insure an bond so you dont need a commercial kitchen.do the prep in thier homes."
IfA170UHjBE,How long do u keep salad before it goes bad
IfA170UHjBE,Great video
IfA170UHjBE,those are aluminium pans. nobody uses tin anymore.:)
IfA170UHjBE,"Trying to figure out how to meal prep gluten-free, dairy-free,  no seafood and no sugar added."
IfA170UHjBE,I hate health problems..
IfA170UHjBE,Does the fish make your house smell?
IfA170UHjBE,"Just curious, if you're meal prepping for 3 with that much variety than why don't you guys split the total cost and each other's food. Then you will all have more variety each week; I do that with my neighbor."
IfA170UHjBE,Seas best salmon not talapia?
IfA170UHjBE,How this is possible that all those meals can keep fresh for more then 3-4 days in the fridge?
IfA170UHjBE,Especially veggies? sweet potato or broccoli.
IfA170UHjBE,I'm asking cause I'm going to start preparing that kind of boxes but until now I was freezing my meals.
IfA170UHjBE,Is it good to eat like this... Kinda frozen food.....??
IfA170UHjBE,Hey Jeff sorry i haven't commented In a while but I've been busy the whole month looking for my lost dog. BTW Great video keep it up!!
IfA170UHjBE,"I commented on the scale video that it was a thin film, why you ignore me?"
IfA170UHjBE,How do you count the fats from the Olive oil since it is in almost every thing you cook? Have you tried Avacado Oil? Cold Pressed.
IfA170UHjBE,"I love your meal prep videos, and i'm not sure if anyone else said it, but i know i had mentioned about the film in the giveaway video!, i'm glad you figured it out :D. i do have a question, how do you figure out the macros needed for you, alex, and your sister? and why do we never see anyone helping you do all the meal prep!, sheesh give the man some credit!"
IfA170UHjBE,I am not sure how much I should be eating at eat meal for maximum weight loss
IfA170UHjBE,REALLY NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT HAD SURGERY 6 MONTHS AGO N IM OVERWEIGHT. HELP!!! 1200 CALORIES CAN YOU DO MEAL PREO TO SHOW ME BREAKFAST LUNCH N DINNER PLEASE!!!!!!!
IfA170UHjBE,do you bake the veggies covered or uncovered
IfA170UHjBE,How much was salmon?
IfA170UHjBE,Awesome video buddy .. next level with this meal Prep I'm still following last weeks prep at the minute  loving the Italian seasoning  .. so your having 3 meals that you've prepped just for one day ?
IfA170UHjBE,"One gentle tip, don't cook with extra virgin olive oil. Use ordinary olive oil but extra virgin olive is good only as salad dressing. High heat change the structure of the extra virgin oil and they become bitter. Good video otherwise."
IfA170UHjBE,Love these meal prep videos! 
IfA170UHjBE,"Question, why the baking tins? Do you just not like doing dishes lol?"
IfA170UHjBE,Why dont u buy a bag of sweet.potatoes
IfA170UHjBE,"Don't call yourself an idiot.  One, because it is not true.  And two, others will do it for you.  Otherwise...love the videos."
IfA170UHjBE,"Why don't you place the whole bowl of chicken on the scale and tear it out so when you take chicken away, use the negative to weigh it out ? "
ngxbaiFL2yY ,how do you make that icing? 
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Hmm...every time I watch a tasty video I get deja vu...
PBu4QQnbVtM ,This is the same video from tasty 101 season 1
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Wtf tasty we know it’s the same video
PBu4QQnbVtM ,I'm pretty sure they already posted this
PBu4QQnbVtM ,11:27 This dude's hands are moving so slow it gives me anxiety •~•
PBu4QQnbVtM ,“You don’t want to do anything too acidic like a tomato sauce”
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Video proceeds to make three dishes with tomato sauce being the main ingredient
PBu4QQnbVtM ,“Seasoning”
PBu4QQnbVtM ,My brain: why I season my cast iron before I cook my steak
PBu4QQnbVtM ,This music is making it difficult to stay awake. Now I have that to worry about also with the hunger issues recently presented
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Who just watches these vids and never actually try the recipes
PBu4QQnbVtM ,"I always knew this bc of my  grandmother , I miss her. Thank u tasty this made me think of her delicious meals"
PBu4QQnbVtM ,My mom legit just surprised me with a cast iron skillet!!!! Wow
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Someone please tell me where can I find this music. ??
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Loving the background music...
PBu4QQnbVtM ,I still have my granny cast iron that was made in the factory in Oakland from the 70's
PBu4QQnbVtM ,"No matter how much I scrub to clean it, there’s always black soot ???"
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Why was the brussel sprouts recipe so soothing?
PBu4QQnbVtM ,"Cast Iron Skillets make the best fried chicken and pancakes & who would have thought that a cast iron skillet was like wine, gets better with age!"
PBu4QQnbVtM ,I watch cast iron's videos just for the girl's voice over :)
PBu4QQnbVtM ,Whats better than lying on the bed at night and watching tasty
PBu4QQnbVtM ,I don’t even have one and yet here I am.

FJr3WD7WNL0,That Mac & cheese gave my grandma a heart attack!

Ge5SjsgaA4o,Why are u watching this video? U don’t have friends or a party.
Ge5SjsgaA4o,"*Easy* Proceeds to cook it, Makes an entirely new cuisine"
Ge5SjsgaA4o,I like how the last one has grilling as the method of cooking when its too cold rn for most to pull out the grill

Ge5SjsgaA4o,"I liked them all, on the cocktail pigs in a blanket, add a slice of water chestnut in the roll up for an interesting texture. Also a tip, an apple corer or oxo brand veggie peeler is great for coring out jalapenos instead of a knife which may punctures the side of the jalapeno ."

Ge5SjsgaA4o,???? 
kN4OSKa-OHs,All that's missing is some cranberry sauce with lots of sumac.
kN4OSKa-OHs,*bon appetite has entered the chat
kN4OSKa-OHs,For thanksgiving tasty should make a bunch of good food then give it to the homeless people ???????
kN4OSKa-OHs,The turkey recipe isn’t that different from Bon Appétit
kN4OSKa-OHs,i saw another comment on this but srsly when tasty makes all this food and comes out with a new food video every hour they should give it to homeless shelters.
kN4OSKa-OHs,"For Thanksgiving , you should stop copying bon appetit"
kN4OSKa-OHs,Whaaat I thought they’ll show the gravy ran out ?
kN4OSKa-OHs,All i have is salt. I'm having salt for thanks giving
kN4OSKa-OHs,Is nobody going to mention that he cuts the turkey on the table
kN4OSKa-OHs,I can see David slaving away in the kitchen for us already... ?
kN4OSKa-OHs,"too bad we dont celebrate thanks giving in my country, i would love to try some of these recipies might use some of them  for christmas dinner tho."
kN4OSKa-OHs,I really wanted to see the inside of the little potato mountains
kN4OSKa-OHs,I wanted to see a cross section of the potato being cut!
kN4OSKa-OHs,I’m here while it still says no views
kN4OSKa-OHs,This looks delicious but mac and cheese is required in my house lol
kN4OSKa-OHs,Real-talk that turkey IS perfect. I made the recipe last year and it changed me (and my family's) life...
kN4OSKa-OHs,Those potato things are not for Thanksgiving. Too much work and I'd rather just have fluffy mashed potatoes.
kN4OSKa-OHs,"And then there’s me, wishing I had time and/or friends to celebrate with"
kN4OSKa-OHs,Imagine seeing THIS in your refrigerator ?
kN4OSKa-OHs,I wish I had smell-o-vision on my phone 
I5NIWGpil8Q,When you thought u clicked on a safiya vid
I5NIWGpil8Q,i can't listen to the music because it reminds me so much of safiya
I5NIWGpil8Q,It feels weird that the song goes on and doesn’t stop and saf saying “hello friends”
I5NIWGpil8Q,I thought this was a Safiya vid for a moment
I5NIWGpil8Q,I thought I was looking at a Safiya vid and got hella confused lmao
I5NIWGpil8Q,I was expecting a:
I5NIWGpil8Q,"""Hello friends and welcome to another video"""
I5NIWGpil8Q,What tf did they do to safiya???
I5NIWGpil8Q,This is the comments section practically is made up of:
I5NIWGpil8Q,99%- about how they thought this video was made by Safiya 
I5NIWGpil8Q,1%- about their opinion
I5NIWGpil8Q,Hm...interesting intro-I mean-background song choice. ?
I5NIWGpil8Q,Safiya's Intro Song?
I5NIWGpil8Q,i like how everyone thought they clicked on a safiya vid cus it's her intro song lol
I5NIWGpil8Q,insert joke about Safiya intro music here
I5NIWGpil8Q,When you thought u clicked on a safiya video ??
I5NIWGpil8Q,??The Safiya music confused me....
I5NIWGpil8Q,The moment when you realise you never knew the back part of the background music bc safiya’s intro only has the front part lol.
I5NIWGpil8Q,I was so confused at the beginning I though I had accidentally clicked on safiyas video ??
I5NIWGpil8Q,For a moment there i thot it was a Safiya video...
I5NIWGpil8Q,“Wait did I click on Safiya's video?”
I5NIWGpil8Q,“NEW VIDEO? :D”
I5NIWGpil8Q,“Oh... No just pancakes”
I5NIWGpil8Q,This is making me so uncomfortable. It's like a never ending Safiya's intro ?
I5NIWGpil8Q,Literally every single comment:
I5NIWGpil8Q,Omg I thought this was Safiya’s video!
