XZDA0gGOnqg,"No joke, I've been with WatchMojo for 6 years now, and this was by far the hardest list we've even had to rank."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Mostly because of how many amazing titles we had to drop in order to keep it within 20, it was easily the longest meeting session we've ever had for a single list, and there were many shouts arguments, and curse words I didn't even existed that went around as we put this together."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo: makes gaming list without Fortnite
XZDA0gGOnqg,[everyone liked that]
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Mojo: ""And the number 1 game of the decade is...."""
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me: ""Wait a sec, they didn't mention the Witcher 3!??"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The Witcher 3 DLC ""Blood and Wine"" could smash some other rpg titles even as stand-alone game. It says a lot."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I just picked up Witcher 3 for Christmas recently, along with the DLC’s and I have to say, I have never played a better game, it’s on another level."
XZDA0gGOnqg,“#1: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt”
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me: Finally, a wise decision..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,The 2010's was a great decade for open world game's.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good list imho. Of course everyone has a personal taste.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why can’t everyone remember that Minecraft came out in 2009
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3's like my favourite game of all time, and totally deserves it. Skyrim is probably my second, so I'm glad it did well too. I've played most of the games on here, and pretty much agree with the list."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m sooooo happy witcher is rated No1.  i can’t explain in words how much i love it . It’s a masterpiece.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Totally agreed, now toss your coin to your Witcher."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Breath of the wild was one of my favorite games in history ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm surprised none of the ""Top Ten Games of the Decade"" lists have included Dishonored. One of the best games of all time in my opinion."
XZDA0gGOnqg,What’s crazy is that every game minus the Nintendo games are all playable on the PS4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Man I wish Xbox put up more of a fight on their exclusives
XZDA0gGOnqg,The fact that borderlands 2 didnt make the list physically hurt me
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I feel like uncharted, Spider-Man, and Lone Echo should’ve been honorable mentions"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I am happy that Skyrim is here ???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Makes me cry. So many memories and a fitting King for this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3's Sidequest is more interesting than other game's whole story.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Once king always king Hale witcher 3??
XZDA0gGOnqg,“Toss a coin to your Witcher”
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher 3 absolutely derseves no. 1 without a doubt ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,0:31 Thumbs down because of the nervous sidekick
XZDA0gGOnqg,witcher 3 on sale for $15. guess ill cop that and give it a whirl
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 is over rated, breathe of the wild was amazing, took the number 1 spot from skyrim in my books."
XZDA0gGOnqg,i am a simple man:
XZDA0gGOnqg,i saw fortnite i dislike
XZDA0gGOnqg,fortnite isn't in the top 20 i liked
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 is one of the worst games I ever played... What is with you people... The game is bad
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I just like mindless gameplay so to throw my hat into the ring, no doom!!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,The fact that im watching this video with my wolf medallion
XZDA0gGOnqg,Assassins creed was one of the best of the decade. If u haven't I'd highly recommend 2.
XZDA0gGOnqg,It's been one hell of a decade for gaming.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"That's unfair, i wanted to dislike and leave when is saw bloodborne at 19. But as i was having lunch, i watched till the end and found Witcher 3 on no. 1"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Currently playing the Witcher as I’m watching this vid
XZDA0gGOnqg,Soo 
XZDA0gGOnqg,He didn’t mention dark souls 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,"There aren't many games I would concede to BotW but Witcher 3 is pretty damn amazing. Would have put Mario higher myself but it was a pretty respectable list, all told."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: I m gonna get mad if it is fortnite
XZDA0gGOnqg,WatchMojo : The Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me : HELL YEAH!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,4:18 Oh so THAT'S where all those uglyass avatars I saw sprout up a couple years back came from
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wanted to dislike the video at first glance after not seeing witcher 3:/
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Very happy they included Nier:Automata, excellent game right there"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Is there a Top 20 list of games of the previous decade, the 2000's? I've seen the one for the century so far as a whole, what about just that decade though?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 was a easy number1 pick for me, that game is a masterpiece"
XZDA0gGOnqg,My favourite games of the decade are defintely Zelda Bow and the witcher 3!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dragon quest XI was so good i think.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Decent list but Bloodborne n°19 is an absolute joke, should be at least In top 10 especially when it's lower than games like Smash Bros ultimate or the kings of linearity god of war and The last of us"
XZDA0gGOnqg,09:40:00 AM
XZDA0gGOnqg,Is that Britney Spears?
XZDA0gGOnqg,So many great games that deserve to be on this list high above some of these like hitman 2016 AC Origins and so much more
XZDA0gGOnqg,Gonnq play the witcher 3 for the first time this year let's see if it's worth it
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Personally, I feel that FF XIV would have deserved a spot on here as well, at least the Shadowbringers expansion, even if just as an honorable mention. But I can see why you wouldn't include it."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Being someone who has fighting games as my favorite I wish u guys put mk (2011) but at least u put ssbu
XZDA0gGOnqg,The list could've used a few more honorable mentions
XZDA0gGOnqg,Even contemplating this must've been quite stressful. Good list!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim is my favorite game of ALL TIME!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"love that you mentioned subnautica. i am with the game since a very early stage and the devs did an incredible job, listen to the community but constantly sticked with their vision of this game. highly recommended"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Opening the vid with saying trials and tribulations!  My favourite track of trials hd!!!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Thank god zelda was high up and fornite wasn’t there at all
XZDA0gGOnqg,I somewhat agree with this list but I don’t understand why bo2 doesn’t even get a honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,No divinity original sin 2? Literally the best RPG since bg2
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm shocked that Ori and the Blind Forest & Hollow Knight weren't even mentioned, but otherwise this is a solid list."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No CSGO?? Yea definitely makes sense not to include one of the biggest esport games and top played game on steam
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo : puts Skyrim and Witcher 3 in the top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me : They are men of culture
XZDA0gGOnqg,Finally persona 5 gets the love it deserves
XZDA0gGOnqg,thanks for putting in nate’s theme. just thank u.
XZDA0gGOnqg,when i got to number 2 i disliked the video after seeing witcher 3 IM like LIKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
XZDA0gGOnqg,Actually good list. I agree with the top 5.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 is #1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Geralt: “Good choice”
XZDA0gGOnqg,should've at least mentioned AC Odyssey
XZDA0gGOnqg,It’s been a very long time since I played Witcher 3 and never finished it. Guess I need to go back and revisit it.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where was Age of Mythology??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 finally on the spot it deserves.Very cool.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I just came here to confirm The Witcher 3 is Game of the Decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,So glad Super mario galaxy 2 was on this list since it was my favorite game growing up
XZDA0gGOnqg,the top 3 were exactly what i expected
XZDA0gGOnqg,Persona 5 making the list made me happy
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bioshock Infinite, FarCry 3, DOOM... how did none of these make the list let alone an honourable mention"
XZDA0gGOnqg,a privilege to have lived in the decade THE WITCHER 3 was released
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No mentions of Hollow Knight, Cup Head, Dark Souls?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow... melancholy hits me seeing witcher ..
XZDA0gGOnqg,"enjoyed the list, but sad that not a single RTS title made it here :("
XZDA0gGOnqg,Okay I’m not mad but what about Spider-Man? Not even an honorable mention ?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: listening of some witcher 3 soundtracks
XZDA0gGOnqg,Also me 2 minutes later :  ooh lets restart the game for the 9484 time
XZDA0gGOnqg,FINALLY PERSONA 5 GETTIN SOME LOVE ^•^
XZDA0gGOnqg,This inspired me to finish up the Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I’m really happy that Nier automata,Persona 5,Bloodborne, and Witcher 3 are on the list great choices"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ohkk... how on earth does mgsv rank ahead of rdr2.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Number one: Not Fortnite
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ye forgot to play halo:reach
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 games of the decade in Japan!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,CELESTE ???
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Now imagine if it was a top 50, divided into 2 parts..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"You know what, I'm not mad. That was a solid list."
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Zero Escape Series on the DS/3DS will never get the love it truly deserves.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Horizon Zero Dawn should have been in the top 20
XZDA0gGOnqg,1:35 Classic sym throwing...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dying Light should have at least made it into honourable mentions!
XZDA0gGOnqg,100% agree The Witcher 3 blew me away was gutted when I finished it. Played it through 4 times over and I swear it gets better. Plus add ons are like another game. I hope for another Witcher game on the new consoles.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"You started hte list with FF XV, really :D That was the moment I knew something is wrong with you :D Its not a bad game per say, but it certainly doesnt deserve to be in any top 20 list, much less of a decade :D"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Overwatch should be higher. It has its own e sports league!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I love bloodborne, and The last of us and Uncharted damn there are so many games I love"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Agree with Witcher 3! Prob swap around GTA and Red Dead though
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher - is number one 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Poland - You know what will happen
XZDA0gGOnqg,dude on the left looks like Seth MacFarlane's chubby bro
XZDA0gGOnqg,Life is strange should've been an honorable mention ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Zelda: BOTW I think should have been #1.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 should’ve been way higher in my opinion
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me, to myself"
XZDA0gGOnqg,“Wow some of these games do look really good”
XZDA0gGOnqg,DOOM got snubbed!
XZDA0gGOnqg,subnautic shiuldve been on the actual list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Man, what is MGS5 doing on that list?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bloodborne, God of war, the witcher 3, Red dead 2, The last of us tied"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made... period. Hell, the B&W ""DLC"" alone is better than most titles out there."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I largely agree with the list. I only have one gripe... Spiderman deserves at least an honorable mention.
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Shadow of the collossals (the newer one)? Detroit become human?!? FIRE WATCH ?!?!?!?! LIFE IS STRANGE 1 AND 2 !?!?!?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Love the Minecraft music you guys played after the honorable mentions section
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo tossing a coin to their witcher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Uncharted theme song in the backround though...
XZDA0gGOnqg,uncharted 4 and halo reach arent even a honorable mention RIP
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Damn! SSBU, Celeste, RDR2 and God Of War all in the same year? 2018 was something, alright."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dear god, as long as nier made the cut im happy."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Undertale just Nmbr 18..
XZDA0gGOnqg,Well i've always disliked watchmojo but this is too much.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ummmm.... Tekken Tag  Tournament 2? ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,I more than agree with the WITCHER 3 being NUMBER ONE.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Man I wish The Walking dead was here
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mine would be battlefield 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,I was just imagining half of them to be ps exclusives
XZDA0gGOnqg,? was waiting Planetside 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Disqualified : Fortnite
XZDA0gGOnqg,20: Overwatch 
XZDA0gGOnqg,19: Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,18: Undertale
XZDA0gGOnqg,Never heard half of these
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm surprised that life is strange wasn't an honorable mention, the game was beautiful, granted there was a few audio glitches but the story and replay capability was amazing, its hard not to love Max Caufield and Chloe Price"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Is doom now an underated
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 totally deserves the top spot. I would just definetely like to add Bioshock Infinite to the list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,me: don't expect skyrim would be top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,"also me: hear the music,gonna play again, install mods"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I am upset resident evil 7 didn’t even get a mention ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fav part of list was that undertale was on a list for once
XZDA0gGOnqg,STRONGLY disagree with Super Mario Galaxy 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watch Barry Kramer's video on why
XZDA0gGOnqg,this was probably made before Sekiro was announced game of the year...........yeah that's it......
XZDA0gGOnqg,Finally some more love for persona
XZDA0gGOnqg,No cod games on her bo1 bo2 mw3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Battlefield 3? Anyone?
XZDA0gGOnqg,This guy looks so much like Wario.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ngl I haven't heard half theses games
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I love how the top 3 games are all open-world, fantasy epics"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo Reach and Black ops 2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Switch Bloodborne and Skyrim and I like the list. Of course The Last of Us is THE game of the decade for me for a multitude of reasons.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo Reach not even an honourable mention? How did they totally forget about it?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I bought Wildhunt and played it when it came out, man was I blown away but be warned, its very long and some fights are extremely difficult"
XZDA0gGOnqg,What medication does the guy on the left take?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"does red dead redemption 1 count as this past decade? bc I think that should have been entered over RDR2 and even then, i think RDR 2 was too low. I think it definitely cracks top 10"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Totally agree with number one, gutted that Bioshock didn't get mentioned at all though :) cheers"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Wait a minute, Isn't the year 2020 also part of the decade? wtf?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I saw persona 5 and nier, "
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'll leave a like and toss a coin to your Witcher
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No QuanticDream, Telltale or Uncharted?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Unpopular opinion
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Where is saints row 3???
XZDA0gGOnqg,20 Greatest games of all time in no particular order you mean ???
XZDA0gGOnqg,The best part about number one and number two is that both of them are on the Switch which means I can play them any time I want to.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fallout New Vegas can’t even get a honorable mention??
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Borderlands 2 ;/ that's wild
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Its a solid #1, loved it, but I personally wouldnt put it on #1 but definitely top 5 easily"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Maybe u could put BO2 in honorable mention Maybe :c
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Seriously, you put Undertale and Celeste over Resident Evil 2 Remake and Horizon? xD I guess its hard to agree on taste after all. Good list though :)"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Henry cavil to the list : Hmmm....
XZDA0gGOnqg,Am I the only one mad about over watch being 20th!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is DOOM?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Legends never die
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Black ops 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,9:18 So excited for Royal coming out in 3 months.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Tf OW? what about Siege, CSGO, or Dota 2? not even honorable mention"
XZDA0gGOnqg,were are my Garden Warfare boys?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I REALLY wish that Final Fantasy XIV had been an honorable mention, that game brought the bar for an MMORPG could be even higher than it had been before... but... whatever.... shit happens."
XZDA0gGOnqg,yay subnautica made an honorable mention well deserved
XZDA0gGOnqg,"this list is pretty solid, ngl. "
XZDA0gGOnqg,but Spider-Man PS4 or Uncharted 4 aren’t even honorable mentions?
XZDA0gGOnqg,gow should've been top 5 at least
XZDA0gGOnqg,I wish Dying Light made it...?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Talk about no chemistry
XZDA0gGOnqg,Best games of the decade: all of
XZDA0gGOnqg,Them from the last 3 years
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: no fortnite on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Also me: best list ever
XZDA0gGOnqg,HALO REACH
XZDA0gGOnqg,They forgot Uncharted 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,I agree with most of this list. 100% on number one
XZDA0gGOnqg,I got super mario galaxy 2 for Christmas in 1st grade and it is just amazing
XZDA0gGOnqg,Did everyone just forget that Bioshock: Infinite exists?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good list though.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why is overwatch number 20!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Where bendy, where Doki Doki. Wtf"
XZDA0gGOnqg,#1 game of the decade for me will undoubtably be Final Fantasy VII Remake and Cyberpunk 2077 ( tie ).
XZDA0gGOnqg,Probably the only good Watch Mojo list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I cant even dislike, this list Is impossible to rank most in order, come on guys."
XZDA0gGOnqg,tf where is mw3
XZDA0gGOnqg,RED DEAD 2 SHOULD BE TOP 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Breath of the Wild should have been #1, but Witcher is incredible as well, good list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hmmm Red Dead 2 needs to be top 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,Was so happy to see Arkham City on this list. One of the best games I’ve ever played.
XZDA0gGOnqg,yay subnautica made an honerable mention well deserved
XZDA0gGOnqg,You put Metal Gear on the list.. And Fallout New Vegas didn't even get mentioned ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,no skyrim tho...
XZDA0gGOnqg,I love breath of the wild but its too.hard
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spiderman didn't even get an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about red dead redemption 2? I mean it is a fantastic game after all
XZDA0gGOnqg,Monster Hunter: World????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not sure how you can make a list of the top 20 games of the decade without even mentioning Bioshock Infinite......
XZDA0gGOnqg,Well witcher 3 is probably best game ever made.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No DOOM???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Loads shotgun with Religious Intent.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Shows fortnight  
XZDA0gGOnqg,Aight I'm outta here
XZDA0gGOnqg,To me GoW 2018 is hands-down #1. :)
XZDA0gGOnqg,DOOM 2016?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Yeeeees, leleleleeelellelelely"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Here comes fortnite being number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo: Hold my beer 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me:Cheers
XZDA0gGOnqg,Stopped watching at number 19.....
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'd put rdr2 in the top 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is dark souls?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Happy to see Nintendo is on here
XZDA0gGOnqg,This needed a top 50
XZDA0gGOnqg,im kinda pissed they didnt mention the return of Obra Dinn
XZDA0gGOnqg,For me Undertale is much more at the top.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I really like it. The story is good and the feelings are so special.
XZDA0gGOnqg,That you can spare enemies is very unique.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Doing a suicide run breaks your heart.
XZDA0gGOnqg,BOTW above skyrim? Nahhh
XZDA0gGOnqg,what about Doom
XZDA0gGOnqg,YAAASSSS. Witcher 3 for the win. I expected gow and rdr2 to be a bit higher on the list though.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Days gone
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watch dogs
XZDA0gGOnqg,Far cry 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead 2 should have been top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,So no max payne no prototype no hitman  no unchartered
XZDA0gGOnqg,Aahh m disappointed with my game likeness genre now
XZDA0gGOnqg,How is Minecraft in the game of the decade if it came out in 2009?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 and skyrim in the Top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,What a decade it has been <3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not fair....at least you should have put devil may cry 5 in this list?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Fallout 76? 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Aight imma head out
XZDA0gGOnqg,You forgot dragons dogma
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Personally would have put RDR2 in the top 5, probably even #1. But then again, i haven't played witcher 3"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Even if this list is debatable, I enjoy the 2010’s throughout my entire life..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight isn't even a honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dark Souls? Dishonored? RIP
XZDA0gGOnqg,I am so happy witcher 3 is the game of the decade... Its probably the best game of all time and my fav game also... But i also want bioshock infinite to be in the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Assassin's Creed?
XZDA0gGOnqg,“... one game per franchise.” (GTA V and RDR2 sweating profusely)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bloodborne ist the best ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dave you sound like you're reading, and the cadence doesn't sound natural. I highly suggest focusing on that as we primarily just get the audio from you guys while we watch. Your team's videos are always solid; great job."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hold up where is call of duty
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim yessir
XZDA0gGOnqg,Subnautica best game of all time!
XZDA0gGOnqg,no csgo?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No MK?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Nothing will ever beat the witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Everybody knows is The Witcher 3. Hands down
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good list..but imo Skyrim over The Witcher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank god you didnt include rpg games
XZDA0gGOnqg,No guild wars 2 anywhere? :/
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Last of us should be number 1, and where’s uncharted 4?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Blood & Wine deserves an honorable mention for packing more content and character into an expansion than most entire games!
XZDA0gGOnqg,My older brother says diablo 3 is the best game not botw or witcher
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think my number 1 game is Nier Automata. I just think that game was incredible
XZDA0gGOnqg,Number 4 : Game Of The Century ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Divinity Original Sin 2 and Hollow Knight would be on my list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Honorable Mention : Hollow Knight?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why is Rdr2 only on Place 13?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Overwatch deserves so much higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,No bioshock infinite ?:(
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why the heck is undertake so far back it should be at least 3rd
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The moment he said ""sorry fortnite"" I liked the video"
XZDA0gGOnqg,and Borderlands 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not including borderlands 2, a game which defined itself seperate from so many other looter shooters is slightly annoying ."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Im sad about Overwatch only were at number 20, but at least it were on the list."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No walking dead? Ok budeeee
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I’m glad Zero Dawn was at least an honourable mention, it doesn’t get enough credit"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mortal Kombat X should be on honourable mention though
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I really hope you guys haven't played Hollow Knight, that's the only excuse for not even mentioning it anywhere..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,So We just gone forget about Spider-Man PS4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Xenoblade Chronicles?
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 13th placed must be some Kind of a Joke. It should have  been top 5 atleast. Beside witcher 3 the best game i have played in the last decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,And Doom had to be a honourable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,"good list, excellent #1 choice."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bl2 should have been on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,You forgot Hollow Knight you rards
XZDA0gGOnqg,wheres uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m glad to see Smash Ultimate on here. A true masterpiece
XZDA0gGOnqg,Damn I hate the colorful shirt guy accent...so hard to understand?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Man Arkham City was so great
XZDA0gGOnqg,rdr2 should be in top 10
XZDA0gGOnqg,I have Witcher 3 but can’t play it because you have to hold down the button to keep running. Painful.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Guy: Number 1 ...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Why do i hear slavic boss music ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,What About DOOM 2016. Did you forget that game
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Great games all around but I feel that because of the longevity of Minecraft, it should be higher than 7. It started the decade on fire and remained a must-play game throught the years"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Well, technically the next decade only starts on January 1st 2021.."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Borderlands tho...
XZDA0gGOnqg,I guess we’re just pretending that Bioshock Infinite doesn’t exist
XZDA0gGOnqg,No NCAA Football 14?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3, to me, had far superior world building, story and quest writing, and memorable characters, but Skyrim had more potential in replay value in my opinion. Some people thought it was only worth a couple playthroughs, but I found the different races, player chosen skills, and factions more involved for the skyrim player than Witcher. The various factions in Witcher 3 are generally more deep and fleshed out and even realistic, but your participation in them in Skyrim is one thing I liked more. I've played Skyrim much more and while I played Witcher 2 four times thru before playing Witcher 3, I will admit to a TES bias. Both are great games, but Skyrim in a few ways means more to me in the long run. That being said Witcher 3 is a newer experience and I'm more likely to replay it at this point in time."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Borderlands 2?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Gee the games of the decade damn near match the games of the century video ?. Devil May Cry  3 or 5 isn’t mentioned in neither yet DMC 5 won an award so did Sekiro so uhh  by all due respect sir WTF. How could it be so hard to  name 20  more games
XZDA0gGOnqg,"“Sorry, Fortnite...”"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good.
XZDA0gGOnqg,At next decate the best game will be cyberpunk 2077 :)
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Fallout 4?! Bioshock mention?

XZDA0gGOnqg,Stardew valley is my no.1 EZZZZ
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Rdr2 number 13 , what? It should at least be number 3"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Far cry 3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ssbu wasn’t in the top 3. Im mad now.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mad respect putting Nier: Automata at #14

XZDA0gGOnqg,Excuse ME? Dark Souls??????????????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Before I watch.... Skyrim better be first ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Sorry Fortnite
XZDA0gGOnqg,"me- ""cries in HAPPINESS"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,So glad to see The Wticher III at the top of the list. Currently playing it again on new game + on the hardest difficulty setting. RDR 2 should have been higher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not just a top 10, nay.... A TOP 20!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No hollow knight n cuphead ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bloodborne!!!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The witcher 3. I totally agree with this one. Soundtrack, gameplay, visuals, story, name it. TW3WH got it."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Omg, i'm so glad that witcher 3 made it."
XZDA0gGOnqg,BO2 was great and where is it
XZDA0gGOnqg,How could you not include uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Where is Detroit Become Human, guys ? Do you have memory fails ? I can accept many divergent tastes, but Detroit MUST be in a top 20. This is one of the most well-written games ever."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"CD projekt red is starting to make me mad....it has officially raised the bar way too high for many many MANY video game companies for many years to come. well, theres hope since final fantasy VII remake might be the next GTA 5 of the 2020's. THEN there's cyberpunk 2077....FUCK lol"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Death Stranding?......Anyone?....please, ANYONE???"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"i saw the video twice cause i thought i lost spiderman, but no it isn't here!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even an honorable mention for animal crossing new leaf?? Lame
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I was going to say, ""where's the hell is Assassin's Creed II?"" Then I realized that, it came out in 2009. Lol, man."
XZDA0gGOnqg,my game of the decade is sekiro
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I’m guessing they really suck at Bloodborne and that’s why they placed it so low. Easily the best game of all times, and consider that it’s the first souls game I played"
XZDA0gGOnqg,ME2 and Witcher 3 are the two best games I’ve ever played. So much time into each game.
XZDA0gGOnqg,20.) Overwatch (2016)
XZDA0gGOnqg,19.) Bloodborne (2015)
XZDA0gGOnqg,18.) Undertale (2015)
XZDA0gGOnqg,17.) Super Mario Galaxy 2 (2010)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Nobody:
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where in God's green earth is borderlands 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm sorry halo 4 should have been on there
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m glad persona 5 made the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,I can't believe games like Assassian's Creed and Limbo dosen't even made it to top 20
XZDA0gGOnqg,No. 1- Club Penguin
XZDA0gGOnqg,Black ops 1/ 2 ????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo: the number 1 spot goes to...
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me: Uncharted 4, right?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo: WITCHER!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me: WHAT, oh fair enough"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Borderlands 2???????
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 should be higher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dishonored franchise should be in Honorable Mentions, at least first game"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 13 g ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4???????//
XZDA0gGOnqg,no Hollow Knight = fail
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wait Fortnite isnt here????? Soooo do I need to like the video?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I still miss hollowknight, not even honorable mentions...."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock Infinite and Metro Exodus not even honorable mention?!  You must be kidding me!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Is the Witcher 3 really that good?
XZDA0gGOnqg,12:27 I would put this as number 1 on worst games of the decade.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank god u didnt put fortnite would've gotten lots of dislikes including one from me
XZDA0gGOnqg,Undertale & Celeste but no Hollow Knight? It should be top 10 at least as well
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think red dead should have been higher up on the list. Like come on no.13
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank Jesus they didn’t mention fartnut
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is fliying gorila?
XZDA0gGOnqg,How tf is bloodbourne below the last of us
XZDA0gGOnqg,Toss a Coin to Your Witcher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,aleged cruelties led by rdr2 construction? are you talking about crunch? lmao you have to be joking.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No MHW or KH3... obviously I disagree respectfully
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I can't believe ""Bioshock Infinite"" didn't even get an honorable mention. I know this is all subjective, but honestly Batman could be switched out with Bioshock Infinite."
XZDA0gGOnqg,OUTLAST 1 FFS .............
XZDA0gGOnqg,As long as witcher 3 number 1 idc
XZDA0gGOnqg,I was kinda understanding for a second why DMC 5 wouldn’t make the list since most of the game mentioned have open world  while  DMC 5 is mostly story  but I’ve stumbled upon another top 20 video games  video this time there are specifically open world. So damn does this list get repeated a third time.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead redemption 2 should be #1. I literally consider it a Perfect game 10/10
XZDA0gGOnqg,Was a great decade for gaming and a great last few years for Nintendo.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Agree with 1 place
XZDA0gGOnqg,detroit become human?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No bioshock infinite ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Knack?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Nobody:
XZDA0gGOnqg,7yo kids: Fortnite should have been the 1st place!!!???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bayonneta 2 should have at least be an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yes but Hollow Knight
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 is too low on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,GTA should have been #3
XZDA0gGOnqg,that uncharted 4 theme at the beginning brought tears to me eyes
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where uncharted ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Check me out for the list you deserve you rpg-heads
XZDA0gGOnqg,Your number 15 would be my number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Breath of the Wild should've been #1.  It was so much more innovative, actually pushing the open world genre forward from a GAMEplay standpoint (which is what video GAMES are primarily about), and beyond that the moment-to-moment play is just so darned fun.  "
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Damn, no Divinity Original Sin 2? That game was legendary."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I’m glad Fortnite isn’t on this list, but the real MVPs are the people who never played the game once because they knew it was shit from the beginning"
XZDA0gGOnqg,How about Detroit become human?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Great list guys. But no love for BioShock Infinite?
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about Spider-Man on PS4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spiderman was fun as hell. Definitely somewhere in my top 20.
XZDA0gGOnqg,uncharted ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not even an honorable mention for Uncharted 4? And TLOU is my number 1, easily."
XZDA0gGOnqg,what about senua
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo reach?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Telltale’s Walking Dead didn’t even get an honorable mention; well, I’m kinda disappointed."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No call of duty!!!!  Why
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead #13 cmon man???
XZDA0gGOnqg,How the hell did minecraft make it so high?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I can’t digest the fact that you guys placed blood borne so low in the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why wasn’t cup head even a honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I would put black flag Ac 4 in there somewhere
XZDA0gGOnqg,No 2k11 ? not one sports game ....wow
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Farcry 3, black flag, shadow of mordor.. I think they deserve more than a few childish games of the list (minecraft included) in my opinion.."
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about dishonored?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Seeing the games that made it and thinking “damn, the last decade had been arguably the best in the history of video games”. Seriously though, we gamers have had it good. I can’t wait to see what the future holds."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good job on the games. StarCraft is ten times better than overwatch. Disappointed that StarCraft didn't make the list. Still playing BOTW and the Witcher and I couldn't agree more with your selections for the top two.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Far Cry 3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Until Dawn? Spiderman Ps4? Uncharted 4? Halo Reach? Diablo 3? R6 Siege? Missing them.
XZDA0gGOnqg,But Good List!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No Bioshock infinite in the honourable mentions at least?!?! Did RDR2 cancel out the first I suppose. Oh by the way there’s this game called Journey, you should check it out......Christ."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wait wasnt minecraft released in 2009?
XZDA0gGOnqg,skate???
XZDA0gGOnqg,i agree with the list but..... where's HOLLOW KNIGHT :'(
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Still, I miss Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, I forgot, it came in 2009..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,no joke idk why people like witcher 3 its just a film whit a rlly meh gameplay
XZDA0gGOnqg,I have never been so emotionally invested in a game like the witcher  3. Truly a masterpiece of a game.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think red dead should’ve been higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock infinite?
XZDA0gGOnqg,far cry 3 shd have atleast gt honourable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Far cry 3???? Or even 4????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Honourable mention : the Dishonored franchise
XZDA0gGOnqg,Last of us deserves to be at least top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Assassin's Creed 2?..
XZDA0gGOnqg,Well you've just lost one subscriber....
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mojo makes a lot of dumb and bad list but this wasn't half bad. They're missing hollow knight though
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dave looks like he really wants to go to the bathroom ?

XZDA0gGOnqg,How dare you not to include bioshock infinite

XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m sorry. DOOM??!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher forever
XZDA0gGOnqg,"An impossible list to make, but the choices aren't bad and I appreciate Witcher 3 at number one it's a solid choice."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dishonored ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Cant believe it,RDR 2 should have been at least in top 10 or even top 3"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Kids who are born in the late 2010s and early 2020s better play good games
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm fine with the list, however I would put Bloodborne slightly higher, maybe switch it with GTAV"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft shouldn’t be at 7 and so shouldn’t rdr at 13 but that’s just my opinion considering I play then both constantly
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bruh where’s Black Ops 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,There's A LOT of these lists going around right now and I've watched dozens of them.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Who knew the best one would actually come from WatchMojo? Well done guys!

XZDA0gGOnqg,"In my opinion, minecraft and GTA V are the two greatest games of all time"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Halo Reach, titanfall 2 and Ori and the blind forest should have been honourable mentions at least. But completely agree with BOTW and the Witcher 3 in their spots."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Also where’s Bioshock Infinite
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 is not even in the top 10. WTF?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I know mine craft is a big game but it's no rdr2 of god of war last of us and it came out in 2009

XZDA0gGOnqg,In my opinion minecraft deserved to be number 1 on this list... it got me through the decade epicly
XZDA0gGOnqg,"My favourite game of the decade is easily Bloodborne. The combat is so fluid, the setting is so unique, the OST, bosses and weapons are amazing. Truly a masterpiece."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight should have gotten an HM at least
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Im just here to make sure Portal 2 and Last of Us and Breath of the Wild are on here. Because if they're not all on here, this list is trash. All goddamn masterpieces that literally 99% of the gaming community agrees are some of the greatest games ever created."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Actually a good watchmojo list, didn't expect that"
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Uncharted disrespect is unreal
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m fine with more open world games this decade.

XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 best for me
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rainbow six siege?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Wow didn’t expect to see Rocket League in the hm, but it’s really deserving. Most fun multiplayer game of the decade for me"

XZDA0gGOnqg,Botw should not be in 2nd
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Great list! On a personal level I would like to squeeze in ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" on the top 20 list. Such an underrated game with stunning graphics, great level design, innovative platform gameplay and the best soundtrack this decade in my opinion! ?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Warm Games
XZDA0gGOnqg,Doom 2016 should be here. Not even as an opinion since I like it so much. 
XZDA0gGOnqg,It's one of the $60 games that gets you the most bang for your buck. 
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Campaign is one of the best, Multiplayer was fun, but needed some work, and Snapmap made the game refreshing."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark Souls 1 >>> Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where tf is bioshock
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Tbh, Zelda botw should be number 1"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where's spider man Ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,no rainbow six siegee??
XZDA0gGOnqg,GTA 5 hands down is the best game of the decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,"why does nobody mention ""The Walking Dead"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead redemption 2 should be second. It wipes the floor with all these other irrelevant titles
XZDA0gGOnqg,Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Cause of its many many...... ""stuff"" on the internet"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where are the rabbids
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 a masterpiece ??

XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is uncharted 4 ?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 should be ranked higher. I'd put it at #1. The Witcher 3 should be ranked way lower.

XZDA0gGOnqg,I love witcher 3 but sekiro should still be top 10

XZDA0gGOnqg,Where da fuq was cuphead?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I can't quite put my finger on why but I still don't like GTA5 and probably never will , crazy to say this but It's just not fun imo.  I prefer GTA3/VC/SA."

XZDA0gGOnqg,Uhhh where is mario galaxy 1?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow.

XZDA0gGOnqg,Tbh I agree but I think a COD game or at least one assassins game would have made the list better
XZDA0gGOnqg,I agree with the list but i can't believe spiderman wasnt even mentioned
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm trying my absolute best to understand why and how uncharted 4 didn't make the list WOW
XZDA0gGOnqg,"glad to see NieR automata om this list, although my personal bias thinks that is should be ranked higher"
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,2. Red Dead Redemption 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ik thats league of legends is 2009
XZDA0gGOnqg,But it’s the game with the most longevity 
XZDA0gGOnqg,It deserved a mention or smth
XZDA0gGOnqg,You guys need to really learn how to say game names and but games by year and you both suck at playing video games
XZDA0gGOnqg,Tbh I haven’t heard of most of the games but I’m mostly an Xbox fps player so I personally think Rainbow Six Siege should be on there but those games must be on there for a reason so I’d personally put Rainbow in top 20
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 Anime Series of the Decade 2010s (2010-2019)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 Best Anime of 2019
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 10 Moments from Beastars
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 10 Moments from Vinland Saga
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow ???
XZDA0gGOnqg,WatchMojo: Puts Minecraft but doesn't put Fortnite on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,12 Year olds: TRIGGERED
XZDA0gGOnqg,black ops 2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No portal 2??
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm so glad Nier: Automata made the list. I can now rest in peace.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Super Mario Galaxy 2 #17 ??? WTF
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not one cod..
XZDA0gGOnqg,In my opinion there could have been Halo Reach and Dishonored on the list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No sekiro ?really?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Literally only clicked bc I saw Geralt. I've never clicked something so fast.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I agree on MGSV and Skyrim. I've played all the Final Fantasies from 7 and above, but I couldn't at all get into 15 with the live action shit. It is not FF anymore(single player atleast - I've also played FF11 and 14) -.- Lost interest in Nier Automata after having opened the game once. I'd love to see XCOM1-2 on here and to be honest the Fallout Games are missing - Bethesda controversy aside. For me one of the MOST important things in a game now, is continuity and thje possibility of being able to keep on playing - instead of the finite conclusions or chronological progressioning. Which made RE2 remake good, but entirely obsolete after one playthrough for me. Just the way the walls close in on you on a run is kind of claustrophobic now. Optimally a perfect game for me would combine Openworld sandboxing, FPS, base management and lewd content =P"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wtf are Cuphead/ sprinter cell blacklist and halo  ?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 is the best game ever made 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Shoutout to all who are playing the witcher in 2020
XZDA0gGOnqg,Persona 5 im happy
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Uncharted 4 or Spider-Man?! Not even as honorable mentions?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,How are you going to not put at least one of the uncharteds on this list and have it be playing in the background for the majority of when youre both on screen
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4 .......
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Great list, but why is Minecraft on it though lol... no one even plays that."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Should there be a call of duty game
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Fallout Series: Am I a joke too you?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Cuphead? Not Even As An Honorable Mention? ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No mario kart 8?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ok but where is odyssey
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No terraria? I'm disappointed, though i would agree to most of the games."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I feel like Uncharted should of been on  honorable mentions
XZDA0gGOnqg,I like persona 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,One game by developer bullshit. Good game is a good game and deserves to be on the list. Uncharted 4 was great.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted..
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft shouldve been 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"damn i gotta play witcher 3, glad my favs at least got on th list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wtf not a single cod or mw stop
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about pubg?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Skyrim is a gem of a game, I don't care it can look old, it is so full that I can't complain. Love for open worlds !"
XZDA0gGOnqg,(I'm happy Horizon Zero Dawn at least go in the honourable mention)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is arkham knight
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wind's howling... Very deserved winner having played most of the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,LeleleleleleleLElelehehelleeleee
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft came out in 2009 not 2011 so should be on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Spider-Man ps4 come on watch mojo
XZDA0gGOnqg,?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fallout: New Vegas deserved to be in the top 10. Damn.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m kinda mad that Spider-Man PS4 wasn’t an honorable mention but it’s ok my favorite game of all time made it to # 2 so I’m very happy with this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Walking Dead!!??!?!?!!??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Can they make less open world games please, not everyone can play 100+ hour games"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dishonored or Bioshock Infinite?? WTF
XZDA0gGOnqg,When you see Dave:
XZDA0gGOnqg,Oh so mario maker's on here
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uhhhh minecraft... ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No fallout new vegas? Ok boomer
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I think Skyrim should have been number 1. Even if it wasn't the game that I enjoyed playing the most, just think of how long it has lasted and how much it holds up. People are still referencing it even 10 years later."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not gonna even mention return to castle wolfenstein, sad,"
XZDA0gGOnqg, just sad
XZDA0gGOnqg,Terraria didn't even get an honourable mention.
XZDA0gGOnqg,How is uncharted two not in the top 10 or even on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Undertale, persona 5, & skyrim ?. The nostalgia really hit me with this list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Først lister over!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"These lists are always controversial. Personally I think you have to be a moron to have Metal gear 5 on the list and exclude Resident evil 2, Uncharted 4 and Horizon Zero Dawn, insane actually. I think the order is down to debate of course but there are games that shouldn’t be on this list that are included."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Why the heck are Hollow Knight and Cuphead not on here?! My top two games ever! Granted, these are all great, but the indie community has come out with so many masterpieces that cannot be ignored!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not a single Assassin's Creed game in top20 ....Man.....
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft should’ve been number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I agree mostly but you should put more in the honorable mentios like : Bioshock infinite, Alien Isolation, DMC5, Cuphead, Hitman 2, Starcraft 2, Beat Saber, Titanfall 2, Control"
XZDA0gGOnqg,When you have never heard of the number one spot on the list lol
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about spiderman
XZDA0gGOnqg,100% agreed
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Resident Evil 7? Seriously? I am dissapoint
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher III made it to #1! My all time favorite game
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The honorable mentions was kinda a joke ngl, they could have put uncharted 4, Halo Reach, far cry 3, etc."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not a single uncharted game ??? Did y’all look past 2015?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4????
XZDA0gGOnqg,I wish black mesa was here
XZDA0gGOnqg,Marvel's Spiderman? Why does everyone forget about Insomniac and their masterpiece of a game
XZDA0gGOnqg,Obviously you've never played Marvel's Spider-Man cuz that game was frickin amazing(no pun intended)
XZDA0gGOnqg,what abt fifa 17
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where was Black Ops 2? And any of the cod games?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why is overwatch on this list XD
XZDA0gGOnqg,"“we’re focusing on quality, not popularity” "
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo tells a bad joke.
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Arkham City |2. Witcher 3 |3. Last of Us
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Spider-Man PS4
XZDA0gGOnqg,"weird list and would not agree with some stuff, like celeste, mario and undertale being low, cuphead not being in honorable mentions, hollow knight and shovel knight not on the list, etc."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Weeb-ness aside, Doki Doki Literature Club deserved at least a mention. All the stuff in the game file, the game deleting itself at the end, having to go into the game files to continue the game, the music glitches moving the plot, and the unsuspected horror of it all. It was a cool game and it was something you don’t see often."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank god arkham city was on here because I thought arkham knight was too over the top
XZDA0gGOnqg,Missing Bioshock Infinite and Dark Souls. I think they deserved at least an honorable mention. But the list is decent.
XZDA0gGOnqg,wow nothing about doom and dishonored.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Praise Geraldo
XZDA0gGOnqg,spider man ps4????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Kojima left Konami after MGS V was released, not before."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mine craft was released in 2009
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is spider man ps4????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Any of the assassins creed games
XZDA0gGOnqg,I respect everyone's opinion and accept that each person might value different elements out of a game. But how is Horizon a top 10 game of the decade in every major reviews website but here it only gets a honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Finally someone knows how to appreciate a Masterpiece ... The Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,How was Minecraft at number 7
XZDA0gGOnqg,What happened to dark souls that redefined gaming
XZDA0gGOnqg,how could call of duty not be on here
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead game of decade detail unreal most realistic game there is 2nd last of us
XZDA0gGOnqg,I feel like I'm missing something; I tried and tried and tried and could NOT get into The Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,How about terraria
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about rainbow six siege?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Very good effort I just highly disagree
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Spiderman PS4 ???
XZDA0gGOnqg,haven’t watched the video yet but the uncharted score in the beginning!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,edit: really no uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,spiderman??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft should have been #1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is far cry 3 guys??.....
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where on earth is Uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Just waiting to finish my Mock exams to start Wild Hunt on Switch. So excited
XZDA0gGOnqg,If you never played the witcher 3 ur missing out
XZDA0gGOnqg,watch moJo
XZDA0gGOnqg,"lol, Arkham Asylum on #10, but the better Spider-Man not even an honorable mention :O"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Also there are some really good game missing that had quite some popularity like Binding of Isaac and To The Moon / Finding Paradise and A Hat in Time (supposedly, haven't played that one)"
XZDA0gGOnqg,wheres spiderman at tho
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The top 3 games such as witcher 3, legend of zelda: breath of the wild, and skyrim also they mentioning open world game."
XZDA0gGOnqg,League of legends not the game of the decade?are you sure guys?
XZDA0gGOnqg,LEAGUE IF LEGENDS - CS GO ?????????
XZDA0gGOnqg,What? No Spiderman??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This is a solid list, but I wish that Cuphead was on here somewhere."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I completely agree with Witcher 3 being number 1, but I would have loved to see Subnautica make the top 20. At least it got an honorable mention though. ?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Very good list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERE IS BLACK OPS 2 AND FALLOUT
XZDA0gGOnqg,where is half life 2 ?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I would have put Nioh too, especially the complete edition."
XZDA0gGOnqg,It displays the actual one of the best combat systems ever imagined (if not the best). It mixes actual Japan history with japanese mithology like no one did before. It takes hundreds of hours to complete the game and learn every mechanic in it. It is actually the best soulslike nowadays.
XZDA0gGOnqg,How can some top games of the decade that weren't in the top games of all times be ranked higher than the ones that were?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rust? Csgo?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Y’all really curved Spider-Man huh?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,No world of Warcraft? :(
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Okay this list is pretty decent so far
XZDA0gGOnqg,WM: Number 11: Persona 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: smash' the like button
XZDA0gGOnqg,"pitty titanfall 2 was not on here, it is an extremely good first-person shooter. I PERSONALLY, keyword there, prefer it over overwatch. the maps and gameplay are a joy to play. if you don't have it, check it out."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I liked Journey better than Portal 2.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think red dead should’ve been higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Love it that you mentioned subnautica! I think a lot of people don't know the beauty of this game
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm glad to see Persona 5 on here. :,)"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spider-Man 2018??????????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"i dont think we can leave out Call of Duty Black ops 1 & 2 out of the honorable mentions. Yes they are COD games, but the 2 best COD games this world has ever seen."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No spiderman???
XZDA0gGOnqg,1: The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
XZDA0gGOnqg,2: God of War
XZDA0gGOnqg,3: The Last of Us
XZDA0gGOnqg,4: Mass effect 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Seeing Nier Automata in this list brings me joy! I don't usually play JRPGs but boi the memories from that game are bind with me for life.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Town of Salem , The shadow of collossus: The last Guardian , FIRE WATCH , Detroit become human , the isle! Stranded Deeeep!! The Raft , LIFE IS STRANGE 1 AND 2"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No League of Legends? You forgot about the big boy
XZDA0gGOnqg,The last of us is my game of the decade 2nd would be god of war

XZDA0gGOnqg,R.I.P.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Monster Hunter World
XZDA0gGOnqg,Beat Saber
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spider-Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERES FNAF???
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think gta v should be number 1.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think Minecraft is the best Game of the decade by far.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"It ist the second most sold game in history, just behind Tetris."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I think almost everybody played it, kids but also full grown adults."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Even if it's just an uncomplicated game without story, good graphics or proper genre, it had more possibilities than any other game."
XZDA0gGOnqg,This is dumb the last of us was the best
XZDA0gGOnqg,Other Honorable Mentions I would include along with the ones mentioned in the video
XZDA0gGOnqg,- Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End
XZDA0gGOnqg,- Spider-Man PS4
XZDA0gGOnqg,- Kingdom Hearts 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,I haven't seen the full video but last of us better be number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,This list is nice and all but where is Halo 3?!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo 3???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Gta was the best
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'd definitely add Fallout: New Vegas and Borderlands 2 on this list. I got it! Lets make this a Top 25 List! :D
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why is Spiderman PS4 not even in honourable mentions?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"1 advice, decade begins on 2011 and finish in 2020. Dont begins in 2010 and fisish in 2019........"
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERE IS FORTNITE ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,ARK?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Good list but can’t say I’m happy that Bioshock Infintie wasn’t even mentioned tho. But hey, we all know it’s great :P"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dragon age inquisition and bendy and the ink machine didn't make honorable mention?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Did Dark Souls seriously not make it into the top 10 at least?  tf?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Can we all just cringe at how they consider Bloodborne, sekiro, and souls all has the same franchise"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft died in 2015 and got put back to life  in 2018
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 4 after cyberpunk would comeplete my life
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This list is so hard to make, since every spot is affected by subjetive things(for example i would have put GoW and Tlou higher), so im not mad, but i was hoping to see:"
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Sekiro
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Dark Souls 1 or 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,No pubg?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo 4 !
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rust?
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR 2 deserves better
XZDA0gGOnqg,I want to love the witcher but the combat infuriates me to no end. Got the game a month ago and I have no idea how the combat works. I started on story and sword and got beat around by everything as lowly as dogs.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Complete mainstream garbage taste
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is cuphead it wasn't even in the honorable mentions
XZDA0gGOnqg,Aw Terraria wasn't even an honorable mention :(
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft came out in 2009...
XZDA0gGOnqg,God of War is numbeer 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,I really don't care how you ranked it as long fortnite is not on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Yeah, great list and all, but it really annoys me that Minecraft was on here and every other “games of the decade” on yt. It came out in 2009. So many great games could of been there instead of it. But what annoys me the most, Detroit become human wasn’t even an honorable mention. There were so many reasons it could be on here."
XZDA0gGOnqg,My number 1 fav
XZDA0gGOnqg,Marvel’s Spider-Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft? really?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft came out in 2009 not 2011
XZDA0gGOnqg,So... I’m the only one thinking Spider-Man PS4 should’ve been on here?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dang, not even an honourable mention for Call Of Duty Black Ops 2 or Halo Reach. Both are really great games"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm happy to see that Legend of Zelda: BotW
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Plz people remeber when everybody cried when the last of us came out i mean the 4 place isnt bad but comeon you cant say that zelda and the wicher are better games , im not saying that they are bad those are awesom and huge games but not better then the last of us , and they should have put unchared on the list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No fortnite, but Minecraft is above rdr2??"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I personally think Minecraft should be number 1, but that's just me."
XZDA0gGOnqg,What garbage list is this? Like seriously hows uncharted 1-4 not in the list and bloodborne is lower in rank than the nintendo barely 2D games
XZDA0gGOnqg,Lol imagine having Skyrim on here and not New Vegas
XZDA0gGOnqg,Otherwise a pretty good list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 no1.. wow..and bloodborne so below on the list...I can't even think why people think Witcher 3 is creation of the GOD himself...
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The games so overrated..I know it's one of the best games I've ever played but putting it at no1... where you have games like Uncharted,Doom, bloodborne,dark souls, RDR2,GTA 5, last of us... Jesus Christ it's so overrated.."
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about Five Nights at Freddy’s? That game blew up YouTube!
XZDA0gGOnqg,top ten video games of the decade and there no any single Assassins creed and Farcry game this is not fair ..........
XZDA0gGOnqg,What happened to?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Marvel's Spiderman
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Sekiro Shadows Die Twice 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow really? No “Fallout New Vegas” or “The Outer Worlds” in this list? Dislike boys
XZDA0gGOnqg,best video games
XZDA0gGOnqg,I want Metal Gear Solid to be continued this is Hideo Kojima is a great game Director I petition for his Job back at Konami. I wanted Team Fortress 2 to make the List It broke a World Record in 2012 as Steams No.1 When it became free forever.
XZDA0gGOnqg,i terraria should be on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,cough cough
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Excuse me, where is Happy Wheels?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wait a sec... 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft was made in 2009 therefore it should not be on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,No COD
XZDA0gGOnqg,"WHAT?! No Pokemon black, white, heart gold, soul silver, X, or Y?!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think not putting monster hunter world on this list is a massive over sight. But that’s the only part I disagree with.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Of all the lists for WatchMojo to get right, how was it this one?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Play the 3 best games of the decade on Nintendo Switch! ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,My list
XZDA0gGOnqg,5. Shadow of Mordor
XZDA0gGOnqg,4. Dishonored
XZDA0gGOnqg,3. Bioshock Infinite
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Spider-Man?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I agree with the whole list?? finally some sense in these lists.
XZDA0gGOnqg,When World of Warcraft wasn’t on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"As it hit number 4 my only thought was ""where the hell is Breath of the Wild and Skyrim? They better be here"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,Seems like cheating when you say one title per developer and SMG2 and BOTW are on the list and Nintendo was both developer and publisher. Yeah LOU made it! But no UnCharted 4! WTF! I’d put HZD and Rise of the Tomb Raider on my personal list. Also BloodBorne and RDR2 is ranked too low but props for Batman AC on the list. What!?! No honorable mention for Sekiro and AC Odyssey?!?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,How tf is telltale the walking dead season one not on this list??? It redefined what story based gaming could and should be
XZDA0gGOnqg,"MGS5 being on here is a joke. Also, did everyone forget Deus Ex: Human Revolution came out this decade? Nier: Automata is also a weird pick since it didn't really excel at anything."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ur really tryna tell me that Black Ops 2 is not on this list?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Since Shovel Knight is a honorable mention I think Hollow Knight should also.
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 is literally the best game on this list by a mile
XZDA0gGOnqg,The first red dead deserved a spot so did spider man ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Someone rank these games...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bloodborne or Nier or Persona 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,RESIDENT EVIL 2 is mumber one!
XZDA0gGOnqg,My top 10 video games of the decade:
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Skyrim, Mass effect 2, Witcher 2&3, TLOU, GTA V, Dying light, xcom, soulsborne, deus Ex HR and Dishonored franchise"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I have a fanboy , a fanboy than hollow knight , and i dislike this video"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yo should i play the other witcher games before witcher 3 or can i just jump into it?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Great list but Minecraft should’ve been higher and over watch should have been a little hogher
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think dmc5 deserves  a place here this franchise  is unique  on its own 
XZDA0gGOnqg,While every game focuses on story these guyz dont afraid  to shift  away and focus  on the fighting  mechanics with a good story and over the top action 
XZDA0gGOnqg,The franchise  wants you to kill demon amd be cool and have fun as much as possible  without  stopping 
XZDA0gGOnqg,i would have been pissed if TW3WH wasn't in no.1....i am still playing and enjoying it even now ( started playing after watching Netflix series)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hold up how the hell is RDR2 only Number 13 ??? It is definently at least top 10
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead redemption 2 is a lot better than gta 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Spiderman is the best superhero game,why is there batman but no spiderman ps4 !"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Opservant Games
XZDA0gGOnqg,"And then you notice, no fire emblem"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Also Deus Ex Mankind Divided is a criminally underrated game and I think I prefer Shadow of Mordor games over Witcher3, not saying W3 totally blows but combat is barely above average and game is a little overrated."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft 7th everyone hate that
XZDA0gGOnqg,Tf2 isn’t even placed on the list or the recommendations list when overwatch is in 16th  “sad tf2 noises”
XZDA0gGOnqg,Path of Exile. If you like Diablo type games don’t play it. Your life will be ruined. It’s that good. In my top 3 of this decade for sure.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Black Ops ||
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even bo1 or apex legends or basically anything that’s not exclusive to the ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Love The Witcher 3 but Breath of the Wild takes number 1 spot for me, then The Last of Us, then Witcher 3. Been a great decade for gaming"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spiderman ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Mario, need to make a vid about him lol"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Assassin creed wasn't even bedn mention why????? I'm OK with witcher but no assassin creed
XZDA0gGOnqg,When you see red dead redemption 2 not im top 5 was disappointed!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about Bioshock - Infinite...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft 7th....
XZDA0gGOnqg,No game in the world was a blast like this.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No bo2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,the witcher 3 is the best game ever made
XZDA0gGOnqg,I still can't wrap my head around how they can stuff a game like Legend of Zelda into that tiny cartridge.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No NBA 2k11? I know sports game don’t get much credit but I mean it’s debatably the best sports game of all time, it should at least get an honorable mention for that."
XZDA0gGOnqg,special mention to south park: stick of truth
XZDA0gGOnqg,I take it this is your opinion list
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think red dead should’ve been higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 3 should've been
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Skyrim
XZDA0gGOnqg,2. BOTW
XZDA0gGOnqg,3. The Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'll never get why americans love games with tons of silly errands. Yes, that includes: GTA, Witcher, Elder Scrolls, RDR (boring as hell to travel in a horse), among others"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Im surprised Journey didn’t make the list it set a precedent for what games mean and how they make you feel for the game/characters
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I will repeat what many people are saying, how is Uncharted 3 or 4 and Bioshock: Infinite not on here? Everything is subjective, but I feel most would agree, these are great games and top 20 or at least honorable mention. "
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark Souls and Dishonored need to be in the top 10 imo :P
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I already know Xenoblade Chronicles won't be on this list... Probably the most underrated game ever. Shame it wasn't introduced to the West until very late in the Wii's life. Thankfully the Definitive Edition should open many more eyes to the beautiful story, world and all around game it is."
XZDA0gGOnqg,The witcher is a good choice but the last of us should be number 1. The game is good for both beginners & is a great story experience
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Spec Ops The Line , Borderlands And Darksiders are way underrated."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dumb list
XZDA0gGOnqg,No far cry 3 ? And no assassins creed black flag ? Wtf
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 Video Games of the Decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Super Mario Galaxy 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,TERRARIA!?!? Didn’t even get an honerable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,NieR: Automata was by far my favorite!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"?(????)?"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,The he’ll is my dying light
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 wild hunt is still the best game i ever played ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Super Mario Galaxy is better than the second one, but it came out in 2007 which sucks"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"it hurt me that red dead redemption 2 wasn't top ten, but I still respect the list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I've played both number 1 and 2, and I have to say Breath of the Wild is my number 1 followed by the Witcher III by a whisker. There is no doubt that Witcher III has a way better story and side quests but BotW's gameplay, world design and combat trump Witcher III's. I cannot begrudge this list though, both games are the best ever."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"OK, it's pretty obvious Witcher 3 is the best game of decade but, frankly, half of games you chose don't deserve to be even in TOP100."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why can't we all agree on the fact that The Witcher 3 is the best game of all time? Only way to beat it is by a sequel: The Witcher 4.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Multiple options for the story and villains such as Gaunter O' Dimm, Unseen Elder..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock Infinite should’ve received an honorable mention ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even a Call of duty game?
XZDA0gGOnqg,They must’ve been tripping or something
XZDA0gGOnqg,2:34 wtf is that xD
XZDA0gGOnqg,Don't forget:
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dishonored
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark souls 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Assassin's creed 4/origins(can't choose)
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The best single player games I've  played in the last decade are probably The Last of Us, Witcher 3, God of War and Uncharted 4 (still need to play breath of the wild) "
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The best multiplayer game I've played is probably Fortnite. Many won't take it seriously but it was the first 100 BR on console, free, battle pass cosmetics, cross play support, and unique building mechanic along with the first time I've ever seen weekly updates."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"It took me 300hrs to realize MGS5 is a bad game.  Its saving grace is how snake controls, but base building mechanics?!  You mean that meta-mobile garbage that plagued AC4?  Grinding for resources/weapons that you never use?  A story poorly told missing its final act and icon bosses?  2 empty, lifeless over worlds? a ""jungle""? Ground Zeroes was its best mission."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Yes, I see where you’re coming from, but consider this,"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Terraria honourable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Lemme see if we have the same opinion on atleast one of them
XZDA0gGOnqg,"My favorite games were actually Assassin's creed 3 and 4,"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"AC origins, "
XZDA0gGOnqg,"AC Odyssey, "
XZDA0gGOnqg,Zelda should've been nr 1 though.
XZDA0gGOnqg,i feel like Detroit: Become Human deserves at least an HM
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yakuza 0 is better than any of these games.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"To be fair, in no particular order, her are the best games of the decade"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Last of Us
XZDA0gGOnqg,Can we talk about how good the voice acting in the Witcher 3 is??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Tough list - not a huge gamer, but played the top three and a few others, top 3 all belong there, you could subjectively switch their orders around ---- wondering if this didn't include remakes or handhelds?  A deserved shoutout to any of the Pokemon games, especially Heartgold/SoulSilver, would have been nice"
XZDA0gGOnqg,the fact you put something as cheesy and 30 years out of date style as undertale on here makes me unable to take anything askmojo evere says again seriously like wtf and metal gear solid 5 are you smoking crack that was by far the worst metal gear game ever made started okay first chapter than became such horseshit after that
XZDA0gGOnqg,"It's a difficult list. It really2 is. But if you look at where gaming is at right now how there's more exposure, respect and money pumped into it compared to previous decades - then I have to say I'm kinda disappointed that not one of the proper esports title was got at least an honourable mention. I mean Dota 2 has made millionaires of so many people with a ridiculous prize pool. LOL and Fortnite has an amazing audience and following. Basically the impact these games had on promoting gaming culture, creating a new breed of celebrities and making streaming a thing is just massive. But all we had is Overwatch and Rocket League to represent. I don't know gaming has been big this decade cause of how esports has establish itself within the mainstream audience and I think that is in large part due to the contributions made by those 3 games I mentioned. "
XZDA0gGOnqg,"i appreciate Horizon Zero Dawn was in the honorable mentions, but i think it deserves a spot on the top 20"
XZDA0gGOnqg,MASS EFFECT!! ? I'm crying to the suicide squad music
XZDA0gGOnqg,Number 1 is a joke
XZDA0gGOnqg,first off upset that Gears 5 wasn't in honorable mentions. second off this channel is crazy! how is the witcher better than GTA V? the only reason people are playing the witcher again is because of Netflix. GTA V is still making money till this day.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No cod
XZDA0gGOnqg,Was I the only one who thought Skyrim should've been 1?
XZDA0gGOnqg,You already know uncharted 4 is gonna be there when you hear it's theme
XZDA0gGOnqg,How is Mario galaxy better than Mario odyssey?!?!??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I gotta agree with the list, havent played more than half of top 20, i would have put Horizon on the list and my personal favs(that i played) are "
XZDA0gGOnqg,3.God of War
XZDA0gGOnqg,2.Witcher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Im surprised gta 5 isn’t first
XZDA0gGOnqg,why is RDR 2 not even on the top 10 list? 13 seems low
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Detroit ? Shoud’ve been an honorable mention at least
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dang! Dragon Quest XI didn't even get an honorable mention but it is what it is!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Great list!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I adore Bloodborne. it is number one on my list, always and forever."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I LIKE IT!!!! 
XZDA0gGOnqg,NYAHAHAHAAHA!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thx for including Persona 5. 
XZDA0gGOnqg,??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Nice, Subnautica for honourable mention."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Is Geralt an anti-hero tho?
XZDA0gGOnqg,the walking dead?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I see Geralt 
XZDA0gGOnqg,I click
XZDA0gGOnqg,I appreciate the work behind this video ... however... WHERE is Uncharted 4? It wasn’t even included in the honorable mentions.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Gears of War 3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where hell is mass effect 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark souls 3???
XZDA0gGOnqg,How can you leave out Uncharted 4.
XZDA0gGOnqg,WIED?MIN KURWAAA ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Tomp  Raider ,Life is Srange, The Walking Dead? RDR2 should have been higher on the list. The game is much better than Gta5."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No Halo Reach, Gears 3, Dishonored, Uncharted, Fallout New Vegas..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Fallout 4?...or Halo Reach?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Toss a coin to your Witcher ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Ark, fifa, warframe?!!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Assassin's Creed game?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dude, where is farcry 3..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,You guys nailed it
XZDA0gGOnqg,Great ?? choice that the witcher is number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,I haven’t watched this video yet...but Mass Effect 3 and Elder Scrolls Skyrim better be on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Fallout 4, fallout 3 and fallout new vegas?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,where is battlefield 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Forza horizon 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Nup where’s black ops 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,no last of us huh
XZDA0gGOnqg,so i guess cs go is not considered a video game right?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Damn no Spider-Man ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Fallout 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,hellblade senua's sacrifice???????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fallout 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is EASPORTSFIFA??!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Stupid list, how could you not put dark souls in it and mgs 5 was pish lol"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Galaxy 2 is way too low.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Were are far cry,assassings creed,ark,cs go???"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm surprised Red Dead 2 is not in the top ten.
XZDA0gGOnqg,If i were to fix it to the best games that actually impacted the gaming community it would look like this:6. The last of us.
XZDA0gGOnqg,5. Witcher 3.
XZDA0gGOnqg,4. Minecraft.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even a mention for Fire Emblem: Three Houses.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Odyssey is the better Mario game both Galaxy games are too linear.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Lol not a single COD, 2K, or Pokemon game, no Fortnite, and GTA at 5???"
XZDA0gGOnqg,And finally a best of video games of the decade list!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No lie, I shed some tears remembering all of these games, the memories, and friends I've made and lost along the way."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Using Uncharted music, but not listing any Uncharted game.... ok"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"My Personal Favorite ""Devil May Cry V"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bro just after this video I downloaded Witcher 3 again.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Edit: I have very good memories with this game it's my first game that I completed. And yet while I write this comment I am on lvl 6 and finding Beron's wife and daughter.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I was about to start playing the witcher when I saw this lol. I hope this game is worth my time.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 video games of the Decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,20: Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,"wow, this list is going to be terrible if they think Overwatch deserves number 20."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ok seriously Persona 5 should of been in the top three of this list . 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Looks like Watchmojo is going to need a change of heart about Persona 5’s placement on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight deserves a spot!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm so early, I don't know what to say"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Nier, yes, one of the best games ever, it was orgasm to play, all 3 times."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"you guys probably just added bloodborne to the list because of how popular it is.. but you guys don't really like it.. seriously, how on earth is undertale better than bloodborne? don't get me started with the other games like NIer automata or celeste.. you probably just read some good articles about bloodborne and then shoe in a quick description.."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Mass Effect 2 is my favorite game of all time. However, I recognize that it had to be either Breath of the Wild or Witcher 3."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Number 17??????man that was my childhood. And number 4 and 13 were a god damn work of art
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft actually released in 2009...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where tf is FIFA oh ueah you re americans but  FIFA should have definately been up there
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft should of been game of the decade because the Witcher 3 had bad framrates and the worst loading screen
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Still, this really is an understatement for The Witcher 3... It's beyond words ineffable!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think top 2 games shouldve been rdr2 and Zelda botw
XZDA0gGOnqg,"A good list but I believe that omitting Ori & the Blind Forest, Uncharted 3, Rocket League, and (probably) Spiderman out of the top 20 is a bit of a mistake. "
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This list is crap. Wheres Dead Space 2,  Detroit Become Human,  Spiderman, Crash N Sane Trilogy,  Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, Battlefield 3, Mafia 2, Ratchet and Clank, God of War 3, inFamous 2, Telltales Walking Dead???"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watch mojo: we’re looking at quality over popularity 
XZDA0gGOnqg,List: Skyrim Number 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I like the list, I just wish Bioshock infinite got at least an honorable mention"
XZDA0gGOnqg,I don't care what anybody says Super Smash Brothers is the game of the new millennium
XZDA0gGOnqg,What's with all the indie garbage games ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,MGS5 was a boring mess.
XZDA0gGOnqg,how is breath of the wild over skyrim lol
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERES SPIDERMAN PS4
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm genuinely surprised that Borderlands 2 didn't even make it as an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,GTA V is 1st  place.
XZDA0gGOnqg,DOOM?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Uncharted? No DMC 5? No Tekken? No Bayonetta? No Modern Warfare 2019?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why is nobody talking about the whole uncharted series acc to me it's the best game series
XZDA0gGOnqg,*Sees SMG2* Me: Nostalgia Noises
XZDA0gGOnqg,"UNDERTALE YES, (stupid game AF), DARKEST DUNGEON NOT???"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bloodborne so low??? 
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dark Souls? 
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Fallout 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"You ranked bloodborne at 19, you put mgsv at better than rdr2, what’s wrong with you watchmojo?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,My personal favourites:
XZDA0gGOnqg,1) Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,2) The Last of Us
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm so glad that Nier: Automata made it on the list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I'm really disappointed ""To The Moon"" wasn't on this list. I wish everyone would play that game."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"MGS V rated higher than RDR2, picking Mario Galaxy 2 over Odyssey is a joke."
XZDA0gGOnqg,AND MISSING FALLOUT NEW VEGAS IS CRIMINAL
XZDA0gGOnqg,"So, no Binding of Isaac Rebirth. Sure..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock Infinite should have been on this list for sure.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ok Good list
XZDA0gGOnqg,BUT WHERE IS TITANFALL 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,A top 20 of this decade without Bioshock Infinite is quite odd
XZDA0gGOnqg,Anyone feel like terraria should have been on the list or atleast an honorable mention? It gave a breath of fresh air to the pixel art of gaming and has plentiful content along with a awsome score that never gets tiring. It was often called the rpg Minecraft but I feel like terraria is just as good as Minecraft maybe even betyer
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft is way too low in my opinion
XZDA0gGOnqg,for me in no order: 
XZDA0gGOnqg,skyrim 
XZDA0gGOnqg,witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,minecraft
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Doki Doki Literature Club even in honorable mention. I'm disappointed.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yeah definitely don’t agree with rdr2’s placement
XZDA0gGOnqg,I guess Black Ops 2 never existed
XZDA0gGOnqg,Marvel's Spiderman deserved to be in the Honorable Mentions at the least !
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Dark Souls 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Breath of the Wild
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Mass Effect 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,man whers tf2 (taht deserved the place of overwatch) and hollow knight
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Uncharted....even in the honorable mentions?..smh
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Skyrim 5 is not that good. Don´t get me wrong, i know why there are so many fans and the game still lives on, but come on. The story stuff alone is reason enough to not put it here"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"How can you include Uncharted music at the start, when it doesn’t even make the list?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Imagine not having the perfect game in the first place dark souls 1 !!!!!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Kingdom come should be in there and RD2 should be at list a top 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Loved many games on this list, but Subnautica was the best game of the decade by far for me."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Walking dead Season 1?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,i was gonna leave the video when i saw overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,Divinity: Original Sin II? :/
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s BO2 @??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thats Some BS right there dude
XZDA0gGOnqg,Borderlands 2 dosent even get a mention??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This list perfectly fit my preferences. Many times i have considered whether Witcher 3 or Skyrim is a game of all time (Warcraft III too, but that fits in another category and another time period), and my final winner was The Witcher 3. So that makes Skyrim my nr 2 but I did not play Zelda so this may be true too. A decade is a long time so, good job Watchmojo."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"tw3 is amazing, but imho zelda destroys it for what it bringed to the table in term of innovation for the open world genre. To me BOTW is the best game since Ocarina of time (ye ye i am a bit of a Zelda fan, i admit it)."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Starcraft 2 or Detroit become human? Really not even in HM
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bruhhhhh. Where’s skate 3!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,saw Overwatch and clicked off
XZDA0gGOnqg,Never saw Persona coming
XZDA0gGOnqg,You didn't even mention Doom?!?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,YES. Witcher 3!
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHAT HAPPEND TO CSGO?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I love the Witcher 3 to death but breath of the wild is my number 1. Bloody Baron side quest is still more compelling than most full length games.
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about bo2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Limbo didn't make the list!? For real!?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Great list, but no Borderlands 2 or 3 and Bioshock Infinite in this video??  :("
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about the rise of tomb raider?
XZDA0gGOnqg,THE WITCHER 3... #1..... BWAAAAAAHAHAHAHA. ????????????????????????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"League of legends is more deserving than overwatch, although released in October 2009, its impact was all throughout the decade more so than the two very first months it was released"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rest in peace Halo Reach
XZDA0gGOnqg,No call of duty? And Witcher 3 at 1?  The list is decent
XZDA0gGOnqg,i´m very disappointed with this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo reach anyone?
XZDA0gGOnqg,hollow knight anybody?
XZDA0gGOnqg,This video  needs more ads.
XZDA0gGOnqg,No league of legends???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock anyone?!? ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Are you kidding with us ??? This list is disaster, I earnestly hope that witcher is not first on the list just because he is on small screens like tv show."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fallout???? Smh
XZDA0gGOnqg,pubg? apex? FORTNITE!!!!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim>witcher3... Always
XZDA0gGOnqg,No tekken? It is the best fighter of the generation schould be in this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I wish Marvel's Spider-man had made on this list somewhere, at least as an honorable mention. But i suppose the difficulty of making this list is a good thing, plenty of awesome games in the last decade."
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about spider man 2018 or web of shadows
XZDA0gGOnqg,MARIO GALAXY 2 ? I CAN NAME 10 BETTER MARIO GAMES PEABRAINS
XZDA0gGOnqg,In my opinion rdr2 should be number 2 on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,I am really surprised the newest Spider-Man game didn’t make the cut. I thought that was better than Batman AC and that game was top 15
XZDA0gGOnqg,My favorite is Batman: Arkham City
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Even though I like Smash Bros. (# 15) I couldn't be happier that Breath of the Wild made top 2, that was the main reason I got a switch and it hasn't disappointed me. Though Gannon is a pain in my backside and I've been playing this game since July.... yeah, here's to another year of trying to gain more hearts and get the last divine beast and maybe the Master Sword before going against him again."
XZDA0gGOnqg,and Sekiro?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No mention of Calk of Duty
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4 should be on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Counter-Strike Global Offensive?
XZDA0gGOnqg,OMEGALUL VERWATCH
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 deserve first place, but they should honor games such as Uncharted."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"RDR2 WASN'T IN THE TOP 10 AT LEAST ?????? WHY WHAT THE HELL, all you guys want is for minecraft to be no.1 or like always top 3, when it DOESN'T deserve it its a sandbox, like a million other games, rdr2 was something new in this stale ass decade, and you idiots still put it at 13 , minecraft should have been 13, ask yourself truly, playing with friends is not justified as thats part of the multiplayer system, a game like rdr2, one of the most graphically inovating as well as immersive game  got 13 ? God of war, which should have been ATLEAST 2 got 9?? What the actual hell"
XZDA0gGOnqg,r6 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Sekiro anyone?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Uncharted or Spider Man PS4 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Erm sorry, wheres Forza Horizon!?? No car game came close to it what a game"
XZDA0gGOnqg,ok if batman it’s not in there I will protocol 10 watchmojo office
XZDA0gGOnqg,How is minecraft not number 1 wen it changed videogaming and the community in general
XZDA0gGOnqg,Zelda Breathe of the Wild 
XZDA0gGOnqg,The last of us
XZDA0gGOnqg,God of War 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Super Mario Galaxy 2 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim should be no1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"It’s was impossible to make this list to begin with but Witcher 3 as number 1 is  totally deserved. I enjoyed rd2 for sure, but still didn’t give that Witcher 3 vibe. Best game I ever played."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not Halo: Reach
XZDA0gGOnqg, Not SS3 (no perfect but really fun)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not Deus Ex Human Revolution (or Mankind)
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not Forza Horizon (1,2,3,4 idk)"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Hollow Knight or cuphead are miles better than undertale. Also Mario Odyssey deserved a spot in the top 10, but overall it was a pretty solid list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Tlouuu
XZDA0gGOnqg,"BotW is the best game of the decade.  Also, Mario Kart 8 should have been in the Top  20 games."
XZDA0gGOnqg,They really disrespected black ops 1 and 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I first played the Witcher 3 in 2016 and it's the only game I ever come back to. I never uninstalled the game and have recently started playing it again (god I love the series) to complete the DLCs, complete all quests, contracts and explore every point of interest on the map. It's not just a game, it's magic. You really feel invested in the characters and the world."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"With a few exceptions, this list is actual garbage"
XZDA0gGOnqg,There should have been a dishonourable mention for Ea sports microtransactions
XZDA0gGOnqg,"imo,"
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Super Mario Galaxy 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,2. Pokemon Sun/Moon
XZDA0gGOnqg,3. Undertale
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Missing from this list: Dishonored, Bioshock Infinite, Civ V, XCOM Enemy Unknown, Mark of the Ninja, Into the Breach, SUPER MEAT BOY"
XZDA0gGOnqg,My favorite is Red Dead Redemption 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not a single Assassins's Creed game ? Seriously ? -_-
XZDA0gGOnqg,Well at least Battlefield : Bad Company 2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I don't agree with most of this list, but I liked only because Witcher 3 is number 1."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"What the hell,are you guys really kidding me?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,The worst list wich could be listed ever???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Are you really gamers?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Have you ever evaluated peoples views?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm so sad that they didn't include DMC 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,i quite disapointed that monster hunter world didnt make the cut
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher is perfect... i would also add tomb raider for ressurecting a dead franchise with style and quality... and also.. deus ex human revolution
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Great list, I absolutely love botw, god of war, rdr2, persona 5, and smash ultimate, and even though I haven't played games like bloodborne or witcher 3, I'm not gonna sit here and say that some games should be higher or lower on the list like some people in the comments, and considering that it isnt a singular persons list, but a group of multiple opinions with means to create a consensual list, it's a splendid list. And yall did good to not make this a popularity contest cause this list would be way different, with fortnite in the top 3 prob ?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dishonored and Outlast should have been in the honorable mentions
XZDA0gGOnqg,Edit - Forgot about Farcry 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about uncharted 4 not even in honorable mention ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Persona 5 and the Witcher 3 I need to play those games ASAP
XZDA0gGOnqg,The top 3 can be played all on the same console?
XZDA0gGOnqg,HOW IS RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 SO LOW
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight slept on again but ok list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This list was a joke. It should have included Uncharted 4 & 5, just cause 3, watch dogs 2, unraveled & subnautica & fallout 4. Is there a top ten list of non mainstream games of the decade? !~!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Once I looked at the description the first thing i saw pleased me
XZDA0gGOnqg,im disappointed that fallout New Vegas was not even mentioned in this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Walking Dead deserves to be in the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"My fellow dovahkiins, we made it in 3rd place"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red Dead Redemption 2 is painfully low here!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead 2 shld at least be in the top 5. I’m sorry but that game is on a par with BOTW and The Witcher. It is certainly a better game then GTA V. I just don’t see how it can be 13th on this list
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm not gonna lie that Super Smash Bros.Ultimate is actually the best Nintendo Switch game in history. And PS4 Spider-Man and Batman are the best superhero games .
XZDA0gGOnqg,I fully agree with choice for No.1 this time. No joke
XZDA0gGOnqg,Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order should’ve at least get an honorable mention.
XZDA0gGOnqg,We even have Witcher 3 on Switch
XZDA0gGOnqg,My Top 20 Video Games of the Decade:
XZDA0gGOnqg,1. Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016) 
XZDA0gGOnqg,2. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice (2017) 
XZDA0gGOnqg,BREATH OF THE WILD AVERAGE SCORE... 97.
XZDA0gGOnqg,THE WITCHER 3 AVERAGE SCORE.... 92.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No Metro? No Tomb Raider? Overwatch is on this list and CSGO is not even mentioned? And who the F plays Persona5, this piece of garbage should not be considered a game at all."
XZDA0gGOnqg,When I saw subnautica which I never really thought it could make it to this list it brought a smile to my face cause that game underrated af
XZDA0gGOnqg,"As much as I love a lot of the games on the list, where is Hollow Knight - it is a freakin masterpiece"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Breath of the Wild completely changed my life, I would give up everything just to experience that game for the first time again. It is my personal number one, but I enjoy just about every other game on this list. Good job WatchMojo."
XZDA0gGOnqg,You made a top 20 list and didn't get Halo Reach or Spiderman PS4 even in the honorable mentions? ?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Most of these games were not even known,"
XZDA0gGOnqg,what do you see played now: Minecraft and FORTNITE!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,No hollow knight on this list? Hollow knight was a masterpiece it was forsure top 15 at least
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 its beautiful?
XZDA0gGOnqg,First I was like
XZDA0gGOnqg,No uncharted?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,GoW #9?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Then they ranked Witcher first and it was all good ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 number one, left satisfied, yeeaaaaaaaaa buddy"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Best videogame of decade: spider man ps4
XZDA0gGOnqg,A really hard list but the last 10 was spot on. Perfect
XZDA0gGOnqg,Am I expecting this to be good? No
XZDA0gGOnqg,Am I going to get unreasonably upset about it? Probably
XZDA0gGOnqg,There is a reason why I played Witcher 3 4 times and I’m on 5 play through ??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Good list, but I feel like New Vegas and Dying Light were worth mentioning"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dosen't the dude in the thumbnail which is a old dude looks like Captain Burns From Fire Force?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Anyone else get triggered by the lack of a Kingdom Hearts III mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dying light?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo in 2040: #1 Call of duty WW3
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Spider-man?!! I call for a redo!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,where would you rank cs not complaining btw
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark Souls?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Who came up with these? A ten year old?  Half look like they're from the 90's...
XZDA0gGOnqg,BOTW over Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Star wars fallen order?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Swore Rocket League would have been in the list?  I guess at least it got an honorable mention.  :-)
XZDA0gGOnqg,Great list but really no borderlands?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank God there is no fortnite on this list?
XZDA0gGOnqg,So the 2012 GOTY winner didn't make to the honourable mentions but Subnautica... did?!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bruh find me a game that's better than the witcher 3, spoilers you can't"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Black ops 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 at 13? Whaaat!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo. I think you’ll haven’t played uncharted.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I dont think botw should of been 2nd
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 and GOW4 should be way higher in my opinion
XZDA0gGOnqg,"GTA 5 at least deserves to come in Top 3 guyss,,,,come on!!!! Also, Red dead redemption 2 is far below....these 2 games are too good"
XZDA0gGOnqg,So we’re cod
XZDA0gGOnqg,Until the Witcher 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4???
XZDA0gGOnqg,You guys clearly forgot about Spider-Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,"When the intro music was the Uncharted theme, and A Thief's End didn't get a cut makes me wonder if it is time to unsubscribe. Hell, Marvel's Spider-Man and Detroit: Become Human aren't even in honorable mentions."
XZDA0gGOnqg,no DOOM 2016?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Assassins Creed Black Flag?!?! Where is it?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about sunset overdrive
XZDA0gGOnqg,Was Uncharted 4 not good enough to make the cut?? I dont understand... Only experts can tell. And I am not
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Skyrim is a gross, glitchy mess with no business in the top 20."
XZDA0gGOnqg,CHEL?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Giving yall a like for bloodborne and for picking witcher 3 for number 1 and not minecraft.
XZDA0gGOnqg,I hate matchmojo and I hate the name soulsborne 
XZDA0gGOnqg,And my games are the best games of all time
XZDA0gGOnqg,"You say you focus on quality over popularity, yet there are no indie games in the top 10. I can think of several. At least you don't have CoD on the list."
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2> any other
XZDA0gGOnqg,tombraider: am a joke to you
XZDA0gGOnqg,BORDERLANDS 2 WASNT ON THIS LIST BUT 2 CRAPPY SIDE SCROLLERS THAT HARDLY ANYONE EVER HEARD OF MADE THIS STUPID LIST
XZDA0gGOnqg,"It's kind of astounding how Uncharted 4 as huge of a AAA title as it is from.none other than Naughty Dog gets so overlooked. It was the game of the year in 2016, not overwatch. Especially since they claimed this list is based on quality and not popularity. "
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,pubg?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Halo reach
XZDA0gGOnqg,"uncharted 4, assassin's creed origins, death stranding"
XZDA0gGOnqg,The top three should of been csgo Minecraft and bo2 I have reasons to back all of these ups
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where's skiro
XZDA0gGOnqg,I wouldn't be able to do a better list. Good job
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Hellblade:Senua's Sacrifice? I'm shocked. That game shaped how I saw the world through mental illness
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 no1 cant agree more
XZDA0gGOnqg,Completely agree that the witcher 3 is the best game
XZDA0gGOnqg,"A list without battlefield, fallout and Assassins Creed ?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,My top 10 would be...
XZDA0gGOnqg,1: The Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,2: Red Dead Redemption 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,3: Mass Effect 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Ka?dy Polak, który to ogl?da like pod kom za Polski Cd project Red, które przebija wszystko. Jednak polacy s? boscy"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Only suggestions id make is Uncharted 4, Fallout New Vegas, LA Noire. Overall great list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERE IS     UNCHARTED 4 AND CRASH TEAM RACING NITRO FUELED YOU KNOW  TOP  GAMES OF THE DECADE WRIGHT WHY THEY WERENT IN THIS LIST IIT SHOULD BE  !!!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Games that should at least have an honorable mention:
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Fallout New Vegas
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Papers Please
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Honestly, RDR deserves better."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Cuphead
XZDA0gGOnqg,I missed Spider-man monster hunter and Detroit become human ...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No Dark Souls, no Sekiro?... Resident Evil was an honorable mention and the GAME OF THE YEAR Sekiro not?!? Thats bullshit"
XZDA0gGOnqg,GTA should have been 1st who agrees
XZDA0gGOnqg,Poland wins again baby
XZDA0gGOnqg,"""We are focusing more on quality rather than popularity..."""
XZDA0gGOnqg,#20: Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,Okay...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Doom should be on this list. But whatevs.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft should be no1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Im agree With all the games, but not in their order. Im my opinion Red Dead Redemption 2 should be in the first five games"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Personally, I think that Dark Souls should have been on the list..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Wow this is one of those lists which Cannot satisfy everyone , but still they managed to pull of a decent one. Good Job guys. Well played."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm Happy Smash Bros is on the list :3
XZDA0gGOnqg,I dissagree about rdr 2. Its a good game but its basically rdr 1 with better graphics. Rdr 1 was revolutionary and 2010 is still part of the decade so im not sure why rdr 1 isnt here instead. Rdr 1 was something else. Something compleatly new we never saw before
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The Witcher 3 is the greatest game of all time for me, it raised the standard for games and hasn’t been surpassed yet."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The story was incredible, characters memorable and well written, 90% of the side quests were so engaging and had their own interesting story. The combat was great. There was just so much quality and detail put into everything. The expansions are easily some of the best ever made as well. It’s the only game for me to put over 100 hours in a single play through. Even after I completed pretty much everything the game has to offer, I still wanted more."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Dead or Alive Xtreme 3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 should be higher...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Just me?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Damn, I was hoping for some Outlast love as well as Alien: Isolation. Both games are kind of brilliant. Good call on The Witcher 3, though."
XZDA0gGOnqg,There should've been at minimum honorable mentions for these series:
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spider-Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,Walking-Dead
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Honestly, Watchmojo is going through a Rennaisance right now. They're making lists that are so much better and more solid than ones made is the past few years, and their viewer interaction is stellar. Keep it up, Watchmojo!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I agree with number one, but I believe Skyrim should have been number 2. The amount of recognition, awards and overall impact skyrim had on gaming is unmatched, and I think that putting it below Zelda is a slap in the face. Honestly Skyrim could have even been number one, but this is one of the few watchmojo videos that I can say I happily agree with their top choice. Hard list to make, but the games that should be there are there, except for Halo. Wheres Halo bro"
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher 3 will forever be my favourite game
XZDA0gGOnqg,Feel like red dead 2 should have easily been top five. And for me it’s one of the best games ever made.
XZDA0gGOnqg,no bioshock infinite not even honorable mentions thats a huge miss on there part huge miss.
XZDA0gGOnqg,The order of this list is seriously messed up
XZDA0gGOnqg,Who wish that Dying Light was on the list? I certently do.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The Witcher is number 1 just because of the Netflix series. In fact real gamer, not like Watch Mojo would put Skyrim in 1st place. Why ? Because of what  players : the community have done for the game, mod. The announcement of TES VI has been so expected for what reason ? Because Skyrim is the best game of the decade."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher completely deserved it
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spider-Man ps4 should have been at least an honourable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,"actually a really good list, pretty much all of my favorite games were in it and i even agree on the ranking for the most part"
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR 2 should be wayyy higher. At least top 3. For me it is the game of the decade.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow this list was awesome but I thought Spider-Man would at least be in the honorable mentions. . .
XZDA0gGOnqg,Don't forget the hyphen between spider and man! ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why does Dave look like he's trying not to poop his pants for the first few seconds of the video?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yaaaaaay The Witcher <3
XZDA0gGOnqg,I like that music from OST of #1 entry plays until the end of the video ;)
XZDA0gGOnqg,love this list - good to see Zelda that high and rocket league in the honoral mentions :)
XZDA0gGOnqg,01:02:00 PM
XZDA0gGOnqg,Just replace the M with a J and it would be better
XZDA0gGOnqg,HEROES OF THE STORM!
XZDA0gGOnqg,None of the Dark Souls??
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yes!!!! TW3 is the GOAT!
XZDA0gGOnqg,How was Uncharted or Alien Isolation not even a honorable mention? I'm blown away by that lol
XZDA0gGOnqg,I am shocked that Uncharted 4 didn't at least make it into honorable mention.
XZDA0gGOnqg,smash bros is the same shit every time and it ends up on the list. ok
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Hollow Knight... aight I’m out
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dragon Age Inquisition though
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Star Wars JFO?
XZDA0gGOnqg,:(
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dark Souls?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not a single Uncharted or Tomb Raider game, no Doom?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"That list is laughable sometimes. At least you had The Wicher 3 and Zelda in there, and no fortnite."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Just some games I think should be an honourable mention:
XZDA0gGOnqg,Far Cry 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Fallout New Vegas
XZDA0gGOnqg,For honor
XZDA0gGOnqg,The only thing I can't agree on is Bloodborne only being 19
XZDA0gGOnqg,Why have I sunk so low to watch a WJ vid at 3:36 am
XZDA0gGOnqg,I believed smash ultimate was supposed to win game of the year
XZDA0gGOnqg,Oh damn some fortnite players wont even know about this games cause they were all under 7 age lmao
XZDA0gGOnqg,Death Stranding?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Horizon Zero Dawn deserves to be on this list. Wtf are these 8 bit 1984 games doing on this list lmao
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo: Double team
XZDA0gGOnqg,Me: Whoa Dave and Ricky hosting this together? This must be big
XZDA0gGOnqg,Sees list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Oh yeah it was big! ????
XZDA0gGOnqg,No skate 3!!!!????
XZDA0gGOnqg,no Spider-Man? :(
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch????
XZDA0gGOnqg,and bioshock infinite?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"And here I thought league of legends is in the list,but hey LOZ BTW is here I am happy"
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Good list I have to say despite it being dozens of other great games that could easily have made. To name some good ones:
XZDA0gGOnqg,2010)
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher 3 gained the number 1 spot without a doubt
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wait how is cs go not even on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dead Space 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Does Dave have a chin or is it all neck?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Borderlands 2 (not 3) wasn't even an honorable mention... i'm disappointed
XZDA0gGOnqg,wtf overwatch over zero dawn..no way this list is fubar
XZDA0gGOnqg,Gears of War 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,Black Ops 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock
XZDA0gGOnqg,Apex Legends
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim should have been #1
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I agree with this list but I do think telltales the walking dead, and fallout NV should of been on here as well as borderlands 2"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"far cry 3 and dragon age should've been on this list, but that's okay"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead 2 is 13 are you kidding me ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No call of duty, halo or gears of war"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No mention of Uncharted?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Surprised Starcraft 2 didn't make it on the list, not even the honorable mentions.  Game was released July 2010"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where the hell is any one of the cod games
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bloodborne at 19?  This isn't a good sign, I'd have way higher.  But dark souls would be #1"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bloodborne came out in 2015, same as the witcher 3.  Those two are masterpieces, but I think I'd put bloodborne ahead of it."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Jedi fallen order?
XZDA0gGOnqg,The walking dead games DEFINITELY should be here.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"How could you not put a mortal kombat title? It DEFINES fighting games since forever, smash bro’s doesn’t deserve it more than MK does."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I’m so happy you didn’t include League of Legends
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 is only #13 these people only play five minutes of games and call them selves “gamers and reviewers”
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo 3 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,MINECRAFT NUMBER 7!?!?!?!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Im crying
XZDA0gGOnqg,Terraria???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Black ops 2 should’ve been number 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Mario odyssey
XZDA0gGOnqg,CSGO???
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Good list and all, but I would have liked to see Call of Duty Black Ops 2"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where was Spider-Man then
XZDA0gGOnqg,The fact that Halo Reach is not on this list or as an honourable mention is a crime.
XZDA0gGOnqg,That game is a true masterpiece.
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR2 in 18th shows how stupid watch mojo is
XZDA0gGOnqg,I honestly think that the Witcher is kinda boring like I played the beginning n it was super long n confusing
XZDA0gGOnqg,You say Quality over popularity
XZDA0gGOnqg,But you but put something like Overwatch 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Over games like 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo:Reach
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I get people have and are entitled to their own opinions but cmon no mention of Devil May Cry 5, or DOOM?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,LA Noire and Bioshock Infinite definitely should have got a spot on here
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where tf was black ops 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,That there are 20 games better than Bioshock inifinite says a lot about gaming today. Bring on the 20s!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Batman Arkham Knight?
XZDA0gGOnqg,All of these games and not at least Uncharted 2 or Uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,NEW VEGAS? RED DEAD????
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Seriously, no untitled goose game?!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"This list is garbage, GARBAGE I SAY!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Too bad terraria wasn’t on this list. It was definitely overshadowed by Minecraft and called a Minecraft “clone” even if it had many differences.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrims heaps better than witcher
XZDA0gGOnqg,No fallout title is a major issue. Horizon zero should have been on the list. Not honorable mention. Rdr2 should be higher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Witcher 3 and BoTW are also my top two games. If we could get a game with as much lore and content as Witcher 3, and gameplay like BoTW in one game, that would be a game to behold. Witcher 3 lacked consistent enjoyable combat system for me, while BoTW lacked more storyline and variety of quests. I can’t wait for Cyberpunk and BoTW2"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Subnautica really? wheres assasins creed? this decade was marked by the franchise and u dindt put one of them...amazing
XZDA0gGOnqg,pretty good list for watchmojo tbh but where’s xenoblade chronicles
XZDA0gGOnqg,Just watched the Witcher on Netflix ...now I have to finally buy the game!
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Last of Us is just number 4???
XZDA0gGOnqg,Man it deserves top 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,The witcher was my fav game 
XZDA0gGOnqg,I loved it
XZDA0gGOnqg,who is cpt Kidfuk?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Nier automata at 14!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Truly the best time 2B alive!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20: Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Me, an Overwatch player:""Happiness Noise"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,The only missing game das CoD black ops 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3 where it should be
XZDA0gGOnqg,This list kinda feels like a joke pandering to the most vocal fanbases instead of video game quality
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top games of the decade! Excited to see what the 2020's brings!
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Lego games
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think kingdom come deliverance is the most underrated game ever
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Jesus Christ. BOTW and the Witcher 3 are so close. For me personally, it’s BOTW at #1 by a leg hair, since I prefer gameplay and world design over story and side quests although those are also very important aspects to open world games. Cant wait for BOTW 2 and the next Witcher game it’s gonna be one hell of a decade for the 2020s."
XZDA0gGOnqg,How disappointing FALLOUT  76  should be No.1
XZDA0gGOnqg,God of war had to be in top 5 !
XZDA0gGOnqg,How disappointing FALLOUT  76  should be No.1
XZDA0gGOnqg,How disappointing FALLOUT  76  should be No.1
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about the uncharted series? Am I the only one who liked those games?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"too soon to make such list, ,  it lacks 2020 to finish the decade , and is a very promising year with games like "
XZDA0gGOnqg, Cyberpunk 2077
XZDA0gGOnqg,TLOU 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s BO2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I really don't agree with watch mojo at times because they did a top 5 reasons why the last of us sucked, placed metal gear solid 5 at number one for worse story but good game, and saying that their tired of overwatch and yet all these games are on this list.  These guys are clearly have no idea what they're doing."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Anybody still playing The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim?
XZDA0gGOnqg,On my own perspective it is the best game of decade.
XZDA0gGOnqg,That was like the most awkward into I’ve seen from a well established channel
XZDA0gGOnqg,One of these guys sounds like the Lighthouse Keeper in Rick and Morty reading his screenplay
XZDA0gGOnqg,I'm happy to Celeste on here. I absolutely loved that game.
XZDA0gGOnqg,16:38 The Legend of ZeldAH
XZDA0gGOnqg,God of War ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4 has beautiful graphics and cinematography and beautifully smooth controls! And a great story too!
XZDA0gGOnqg,where’s MGSV lmao
XZDA0gGOnqg,were is south park:tsot and tfbw?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"No fornite, well done..."
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Dark souls??? Wtf watchmojo
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where's CS go sksksksk
XZDA0gGOnqg,Skyrim ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Devil May Cry 5 can't even get an honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No re 7 or re 2  in the top 20 wowww!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"These lists keep sleeping on Xenoblade Chronicles (and to a lesser extent, Journey). Still, good list! Definitely more than 20 games worthy of a shout out though"
XZDA0gGOnqg,where's Blood stained ritual of the night
XZDA0gGOnqg,Gonna go and replay Skyrim right now
XZDA0gGOnqg,Witcher 3  Love this GAME  :)
XZDA0gGOnqg,The WitcherZZZZzzzzZZZZzzzzZZZ
XZDA0gGOnqg,PUT SOME RESPECT ON UNCHARTED 4 WATCHMOJO
XZDA0gGOnqg,Cuphead didn’t even get an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Thank you for not putting fortnite on this.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"You are so right, about The Witcher 3!!!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No love for Uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"hahaha fortnite bad, you can laugh and leave a like now."
XZDA0gGOnqg,They should have put Hollow Knight on this list instead of Celeste
XZDA0gGOnqg,I completely agree with #1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 3!?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Genio quiz YouTubers 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about CoD mw and mw2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is hzd?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red dead redemption 2 should have been higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,Doom doesn't make it in the list for some reason
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Satan: BOY, WE NEED TO TALK"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"New Vegas should get honorable mention, RDR2 should switch places with Skyrim and they should put Portal 2 on number #4 or #2. Who agrees?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,You talk about quality and yet you do not put up Disco Elysium? Unreal.
XZDA0gGOnqg,If MGS 5 wasn’t a metal gear game it would of been a good game but Mgs 5 took me straight out of the metal gear universe and I just couldn’t get into it
XZDA0gGOnqg,u forgot about dino on chrome
XZDA0gGOnqg,who is uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,good with the list but think horizon zero dawn should have been a top 5 game.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I agree for the most part, but God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 deserved to be higher. Of course it comes down to preference."
XZDA0gGOnqg,the 2.8k people who disliked probably play fortnite lmao
XZDA0gGOnqg,Dark Souls > Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4 anyone??
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Shouldn’t league get some spot? I never like the game but no denial that this not only changed the game industry but also influenced the world’s economy, became base of the esport"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Bloodborne should be higher in this list and not even a mention of Dark Souls trilogy, and the 2019 GOTY Sekiro? Shame."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I agree with the list but I’m really disappointed that Dark souls 1 was not even a honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,What about Spider-Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Bioshock Infinite?
XZDA0gGOnqg,The witcher 3 couldnt keep my attention. Skyrim was one of the worst games I've ever played.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Life is Strange and any one Assassin's Creed game should have been on the honorable mentions.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even an honourable mention for spider man 2018
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 13..
XZDA0gGOnqg,Bioshock infinite...........
XZDA0gGOnqg,No Counter-Strike Global Offensive at all???!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Few other games should be on the list:
XZDA0gGOnqg,1) Uncharted 4
XZDA0gGOnqg,2) CS: Go
XZDA0gGOnqg,3) Call of duty Ghost
XZDA0gGOnqg,This list was bad tho
XZDA0gGOnqg,I think Days Gone deserved an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spiderman ps4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Every game above Overwatch in this list is bullshit. Esp MGSV and Persona 5 like good games but c'mon
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is pubg and Detroit
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not even a single Assassins creed?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is Dark Souls? Bloodborne is worse than Dark Souls. I do not recognize you guys.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Way too many platform & console games. Where is Fallout 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Read dead should be ranked higher
XZDA0gGOnqg,An absolute crime Journey isn't here.
XZDA0gGOnqg,How was Spider-Man PS4 not on this list?
XZDA0gGOnqg,20) Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,19) Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,18) Undertale
XZDA0gGOnqg,17) Super Mario Galaxy 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,Seriously resident evil 7 isn't even in honorable mentions?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not a SINGLE Assassins Creed game? Not even as an honourable mention? The score alone is masterful!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Didn't Minecraft release in 2009?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Im sad that monster hunter world wasnt on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I think Uncharted, Assassins Creed, The Walking Dead & Spider Man deserve to be in the list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Should have add call of duty modern warfare, that game truly shaped war and shooting genre."
XZDA0gGOnqg,So spiderman just doesnt even at least an honorable mention? Tf?
XZDA0gGOnqg,If New Vegas isn't on here it's getting disliked
XZDA0gGOnqg,MGSV has no place here
XZDA0gGOnqg,WatchMojo may have just convinced me to buy The Witcher 3.. I also love the style of two narrators on one video
XZDA0gGOnqg,"0:43 ""focusing more on quality than on popularity"""
XZDA0gGOnqg,titanfall 2 not even getting to the honorable mentions: am i a joke to you?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red Dead Redemption 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,My favorite game of all time
XZDA0gGOnqg,No mention of Alien: Isolation? Shame!
XZDA0gGOnqg,20. Fallout: New Vegas
XZDA0gGOnqg,19. Inside
XZDA0gGOnqg,18. Portal 2
XZDA0gGOnqg,17. BioShock Infinite
XZDA0gGOnqg,Here ideas
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 anime battles of the decade 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 cartoons of the decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,Top 20 movies of the decade
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Why isn't DOOM (2016) on this list? It's one of the most incredible groundbreaking games of the entire decade! Not only is it a worthy successor to one of the most influential titles in gaming history that defines the FPS genre, but DOOM is quite possibly even the greatest FPS game of all time! (Until Doom Eternal comes out that is!) Honestly, it at least deserves an honorable mention, if not a well deserved spot on this list!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo 2016: Uncharted 4 is the best ps4 game 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Watchmojo 2019: Not including it on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Red Dead 2 is way too low. That game is a masterpiece. Good list though.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Not having Borderlands 2 as at least an honorable mention is a cruel joke.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spiderman
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher 3 is my favorite game this console generation.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Im happy bloodborne on the list but it should be at least top 15 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Terraria
XZDA0gGOnqg,"The first Dark Souls is one of the most influential games of the 2010's by far, and it doesn't even make the top 20?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 2 theme at start is epic.
XZDA0gGOnqg,The Witcher 3 is truly the game of the decade the amount of content(top quality) with the DLC's is just astounding.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow no Fornite that’s a surprise I honestly don’t like Fortnite all that much but u gotta give credit to where it’s due I’m just sayin
XZDA0gGOnqg,"A shame to not see Halo Reach on the list or as part of the honourable mentions. As a final pastiche of everything the Bungie Halo series got right, to me Reach was a perfect send off with a stunning campaign, fun and fleshed out online and perfected Forge mode. Having replayed the Halo games recently, Reach certainly stands out as my favourite of the Bungie series."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Wooooow, so we're totally just going to snub Uncharted 3 and 4? Wooooow smh"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Lets go boys! Witcher 3!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,If you don't want to watch
XZDA0gGOnqg,20. Overwatch
XZDA0gGOnqg,19. Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,18. Undertale
XZDA0gGOnqg,completly agree with nr 1
XZDA0gGOnqg,Minecraft and Portal 2 better than Red Dead Redemption 2 and God of War? Wow. They only acceptable choice they made was The Witcher 3.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mafia 2 woulda been nice to be in memorable mentions...great story and extremely realistic car handling.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Till 6:50 I havent played or heard almost about any of those games at all, wtf was that list man?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Uncharted 4 ? that Soundtrack ahhhh awesome!
XZDA0gGOnqg,I totaly agree with this list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,It seems that I have played it safe by owning a ps4 and a n.switch....nice
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Red Dead Redemption 2 was so low on this list. In my opinion, it’s at least a top five."
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yooo opening the video with the uncharted theme you won me over no matter what.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Edit Great video watchmojo!
XZDA0gGOnqg,"So glad overwatch made the list, even tho it was at 20. I did not expect that"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Its impossible to choose 20 best games from the past 10 years
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I would have flipped The Witcher 3 and Skyrim’s position, and removed MGSV in favor of Dishonored 2."
XZDA0gGOnqg,I would love to see Dota 2 in here. At least an honorable mention
XZDA0gGOnqg,Ok RDR2 is a top 5 game easily and HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE UNCHARTED 4 ON THIS LIST?????
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo Reach and Assassin's Creed dont get an honorable mention?
XZDA0gGOnqg,WHERE THE HELL IS DARK SOUSL!!!!!!!!!!!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Rdr2 should’ve been higher.
XZDA0gGOnqg,where’s uncharted 3?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I got the feeling they forgot that Diablo 3 exist. And (imo) could easily bump back the likes of minecraft and GTA5 for their spot.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Timestamps!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Horizon Zero Dawn. They built something very special with this game.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Not only the best game of the decade, best game of all time!!!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,so you play the uncharted theme during the opening yet don't acknowledge Uncharted 4?
XZDA0gGOnqg,So you ranked RDR2 as the best game of 2018 yet in this list you ranked God of War above RDR2? Ok.
XZDA0gGOnqg,RDR 2 at number 13! I vehemently disagree
XZDA0gGOnqg,Hollow Knight should have been on the list
XZDA0gGOnqg,Call me crazy but I think Life Is Strange 1 deserved an honorable mention...
XZDA0gGOnqg,This is great but...
XZDA0gGOnqg,19 Bloodborne ?? WOW
XZDA0gGOnqg,With respect...
XZDA0gGOnqg,The others are garbage compared to Bloodborne
XZDA0gGOnqg,Halo Reach and Fallout New Vegas MUST be in this top 20
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dude, where is Rainbow Six Siege?"
XZDA0gGOnqg,where is dota 2?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Tomb Raider not even getting an honourable mention? What a let down...
XZDA0gGOnqg,Horizon zero dawn an honourable mention? No uncharted? Sekiro?
XZDA0gGOnqg,No no no.
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where df is DOOM
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Minecraft has to be number 1, it is undeniably the most impactful game of the decade."
XZDA0gGOnqg,But not having Fortnite on the list makes me actually like a mojo list.
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Dark Souls, ME2, RDR2, Bioshock Infinite, GoW, Fallout New Vegas and BoTW are just a few of the games better than Quen 3."
XZDA0gGOnqg,"I Like their List, I'm just gonna Add some Games that I Personally Like this Decade "
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Detroit Become Human
XZDA0gGOnqg,-Devil May Cry 5
XZDA0gGOnqg,But dead by daylight
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where is RDR2
XZDA0gGOnqg,How the hell is The Phantom Pain a game that isn't even a finished product ahead of RDR 2 ?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Far Cry 3,4,5, or any far cry from the decade"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Sad that horizon zero dawn is in honorable mentions. But no shadow of war or uncharted or tomb raider?
XZDA0gGOnqg,Yeah Witcher 3
XZDA0gGOnqg,The bloodborne disrespect
XZDA0gGOnqg,But what about Fallout:New Vegas
XZDA0gGOnqg,no halo :(
XZDA0gGOnqg,Where’s Assassin’s Creed at
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Uncharted 4, Spider-Man, what remains of Edith finch, Mario kart deluxe and walking dead season 1 all deserve HM at least!"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Pubg?
XZDA0gGOnqg,I mean it paved the way to another genre of games right?
XZDA0gGOnqg,"Even tho pubg is not the first battle Royale game but it became popular and dubbed as the game that paved the way to battle Royale, well......"
XZDA0gGOnqg,No borderlands!
XZDA0gGOnqg,Wow really shocked that not even an honourable mention for
XZDA0gGOnqg,Spider Man
XZDA0gGOnqg,Luigi ghost mansion 3 
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mario Odyssey  
XZDA0gGOnqg,Mafia 2 not even an honorable mention.

XZDA0gGOnqg,Bruh wheres Arkham knight
XZDA0gGOnqg,Journey is not there?? RDR2 is 13?? I don’t agree at all with this
XZDA0gGOnqg,"As a bloodborne elite i was kinda sad it’s only 19, but at least it made the list"
XZDA0gGOnqg,Let me guess:
XZDA0gGOnqg,5 GTA V
XZDA0gGOnqg,4 Last of Us

XZDA0gGOnqg,World of warcraft 
XZDA0gGOnqg,The witcher 3

NK9F1zwBNug,"38:43. Ellie's like: ""Uughh! Did I really just kiss that thing?"""
NK9F1zwBNug,When video game trailers have better CGI and graphics than most movies today.
NK9F1zwBNug,The only games I want on this list is The Last Of Us 2 and Cyberpunk 2077.
NK9F1zwBNug,I got a fortnite add ! Seriously is that game not gonna die ?
NK9F1zwBNug,I take it that the Far Cry:New Dawn is the sequel to Far Cry 5?
NK9F1zwBNug,is it just me or is every game basically post apocalypic & have 1 eye symbolism rampant symbolizing the antichrist in these trailers.
NK9F1zwBNug,You forgot to put Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord in the list.
NK9F1zwBNug,We need another halo infinite trailer
NK9F1zwBNug,Honestly I don't think anything will be more anticipated than cyberpunk 2077
NK9F1zwBNug,Well far cry will be a flop !
NK9F1zwBNug,It would be good if they showed some actual gameplay.

NK9F1zwBNug,"The Last of us 2, Call of Duty, Ghost of Tshushima"
NK9F1zwBNug,"Graphics are beautiful, but how much innovation and actual radical different game play will there be?"
NK9F1zwBNug,"Death stranding wow this needs a projector in a dark room, cinematic trailor"
NK9F1zwBNug,"Jonny Yong Bosch: ""Get lit!"""

Vrg4KlKnKoY,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will always be at the top spot for me! A true Masterpiece by CDPR!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,so Mario doesn't even deserve an honorable mention.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is assassin's creed
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Kid when fortntie not in this: visible confusion
Vrg4KlKnKoY,GTA San Andreas was definitely my memorable game but shame it’s not on the list.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,08:46:00 AM
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"WM: “Bioshock"" (2006)"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Bioshock fans: Um, actually it's 2007"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Can’t believe there’s no Red Dead Redemption 2 that made me cry like a girl
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Should have had Metroid Prime in there. At least honorable mentions.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,That Resident Evil 4 soundtrack in the beginning gave my chills!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Does anyone agree that Knights of the Old Republic should have been on this list?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Best Game of 2000's: Half-Life 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Best Game of Century: Half-Life 2

Vrg4KlKnKoY,3:23 the foundation was actually Demon Souls
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I feel like Last of Us should be higher.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""Looks like your.... Hour, has come again."" -GMan."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dr Freeman's next 'hour' can't come bloody quickly enough.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Personally I think one of the ‘Assassins Creed’ titles belong on the list... Black Flag was an incredible game with a great storyline and brilliant mechanics
Vrg4KlKnKoY,O man i would have liked this list even more if Devil May Cry was on here.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""Pick Up That Can"""
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Words that define a century of game publishers slowly realizing more and more how many immoral and shady profit tactics they can get away with in the video game industry.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I’m glad to see Halo CE on here BUT where’s Horizon Zero Dawn?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"With memes aside, Minecraft was truely a revolution in the history of gaming. If it were the list from 2010 to 2020, I would say Minecraft takes the top spot!"

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Cries in Red dead redemption 2

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Im glad you've included Skyrim though.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world."" - GMan"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I'm just glad Half-Life 2 is their #1 pick.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Half-Life Is too Good But Also don't Forgot assassin's creed.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"10:31 if 'importance' takes the cake within a franchise over what is best, then how about ""most important/iconic games"" rather than a title with 'best'"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,no Crysis
Vrg4KlKnKoY,no Far Cry 3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,no Fallout 3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,no Mirror's Edge

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"You had one job, guys"

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dislike says that all
Vrg4KlKnKoY,U just cant rank these type of things 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Everyone has their own favourites ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dislike says that all
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Really love the respect for Celeste. It's my favorite indie even higher than Hollow Knight and Cuphead. Celeste was beautiful.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Number 1 the most overrated game of the century, hint... there’s never going to be a part 3"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What's it gonna take for Persona 4 golden or Persona 5 to get some recognition?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Far cry 3?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I was expecting The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt to be #1 on this list as well
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"i havent bought console since ps2 lol it's sad to miss out on games like uncharted, botw, and tlou"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,FINALLY SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS GETS THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES!!!!!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic!? It should’ve at least been in the honorable mentions
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Loved Legacy of Kain soul reaver 2, know it’s to old but it got me into gaming and now have wasted a gazilion hours of great games. I think Halo should be number one though."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is darling smackdown pain or wwe2k19
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"So DOOM, arguably the most influential fps of all time, isn't even an honorable mention? Nice. Real nice."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I haven't watched yet but Crysis on PC better be in here!! Edit: and BF2... no Tomb Raider?!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"That's, not CoD 4, that's the remaster"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"So the game with the highest e-sports prize pool ever ""DOTA 2"" is not on the list!!!"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I recently played and finished half life 2 and it does not age well in my eyes at least
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"BIOSHOCK:Infinite undoubtedly is a legendary game in the gaming history, should be in top 5"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I have yet to play Mass Effect 2, I only played a bit of 1 on PC. I'm waiting for a remaster on consoles, I hope they do it someday."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,That Resident evil 4 theme song at the start of the video was spot on.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"so AC disappeared? that was a revolutionizer for stealth games especially AC1,2"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Gotta admit, I built a gaming rig just for Half Life 2 (and Doom 3) back in early 2000's."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Not a single Final Fantasy game - shows how far, tongue in cheek, the series has come."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"After Half Life Alyx Valve better release HL3 soon, at least while the generation eager for it is alive."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Good list, I might shuffle some stuff around for game of the century but for influence this is good. I also thought Max Payne might deserve at least an honourable mention"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I think league of legends should be at least number 5 I was basically the game that make Esports well Esports also I am still waiting for Half life 3 please valve hear my prayers I may die soon and i would like to played
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"No Fallout, Rimworld or Football Manager?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Wait I just realized..where Metroid Prime at???
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Super Mario Galaxy or Oddysey did not even make it in honorable mentions...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dislike
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I was gully expecting Deus Ex to be #1 after seeing The Witcher 3 at #2, but it was Half Life 2, like wtf."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dissapointed for not including my favorite game of all time Bloodborne!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I haven't saw the video....
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I'm just here to see witcher 3 as no. 1
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Totally agree with that #1 spot. Half-Life 2 did everything right. I've played it multiple times since its release back in 2005. It's sad we'll never see a proper sequel.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,resident evil 4 save music...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,well you earned a like watchmojo...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I'm perfectly ok with half life 2 being number 1. Such a phenomenal game.  I would have liked to see a fallout game on this list though
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Honestly, Witcher 3 just gets everything right."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,GTA 5 above the Last of Us??????anyway it's ur opinion so I respect it
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"so glad to you guys to put cod4 mw, that is a masterpiece game"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,was expecting to see DMC
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I like the re4 soundtrack?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Of course half life 2 I played it a long time ago and again recently and it does not hold up that well it's fine but theres plenty of better games
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"DOOM 2016 doesn't even get an honorable mention, eh?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,heavy metal music intensifies
Vrg4KlKnKoY,how did some of these beat out Red Dead Redemption 2...this is OUTRAGE!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I HAAAATED half life 2.....but If anybody remembers Coliseum: Road To Freedom...then they know that deserves at least an honorable mention
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I came for GOD OF WAR, and I thank you for that. Mates."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"A palace can't be built without a foundation? The foundation was Demon Souls, not Dark Souls 1 :)"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I know I'm in the VAST minority that thought HL2 was average at best, but I'm sure most would agree that giving it the top spot is pretty absurd. Metroid Prime will always be the goat FPS"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,LLLLEEEEERRRROOOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYYYY JENKINS!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,half life 2 is important and amazing but THE best? eh...it's one of the most important games and one of the best but I see it's influence over it's quality in terms of it's strength mainly still a masterpiece
Vrg4KlKnKoY,replace smash with RED DEAD Redemption 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,replace smash with RED DEAD Redemption 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Bloodborne should be there (no it isnt same brand as dark souls just like uncharted isnt same brand as the last of us. Its just from the same studio as dark souls)
Vrg4KlKnKoY,WoW <3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,You guys have the second best Halo and Zelda on the list lol
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I see Mr. Freeman, I click"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,REALLY
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What about COD ... Battlefield .. NFS MW ..  Even Generals:zero hour !!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"A single MOBA game, even that one only as a honorable mention. Even though they rule the overall prize pools in Esports by far. Cmon..."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""Ann Rand"""
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Love the resident evil 4 music at the beginng
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where’s Assassins Creed 2?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"All we had to do, was mention the correct GTA watchmojo!!"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I've never played Half Life 2 but I feel it's overrated already lol. I plan to play it someday  though.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Borderlands 2 love here?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Out of all the mgs games you chose the worst one?????
Vrg4KlKnKoY,SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS!!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Im confused as to how league of legends is on the honorable mention? Is the game that good? Damn
Vrg4KlKnKoY,RDR or RDR 2 has to crack the top 20
Vrg4KlKnKoY,My favourites are 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Shadow of the colossus and bioshock and of course the legendary RE4.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dark Souls only 18??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,It should be WAYYY higher than that
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is Red Dead Redemption 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"HF2 on the top, I would grudgingly accept. Now, if only Valve would pull up their socks and announce what we all been wanting to hear since 2004..."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Yo the thing is I grew up on these games and a lot are number 1,2 for me. Love the list"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Great list, but uh...where’s Horizon Zero Dawn? Or any of the Mario games??"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I thought for sure a final fantasy game would have made it on the list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,honorable mention: Doom
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""Halo did for first person shooters..."" No, Halo did for VIDEO GAMES what citizen kane did for film. Everyone  tried Halo. Doom started it, GoldenEye advanced it, Halo evolved it."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dark souls deserves to be atleast somewhere at the top 10
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Mass Effect 2 and Uncharted 2 are my favorite games of all time.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I knew it ..Half life 2 all the way .
Vrg4KlKnKoY,@2:53 'wilfully obtuse'
Vrg4KlKnKoY, please explain how a game can be obtuse
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Super smash Bros Melee is alive because how perfect the multiplayer gameplay it has created. A frickin fighting game, not a strategy game or fps. Sakurai is blessed with design."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Was scared they weren't going to mention WoW. Glad they did.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Metroid prime should be above halo and at least in the top 3 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Imo

Vrg4KlKnKoY,God of war really to me want that good
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"They got #1 right, although i would have skyrim 2nd, with the new red dead as 3"

Vrg4KlKnKoY,As long as Half life 2 is number 1 im fine with the list...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Ummm... #1 should be America's Army 2

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Skimmed through to make sure the witcher was on it

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Yes! Half Life 2 numero 1
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Wow.  Surprisingly good list.  The only games on here that aren't among my favorites of the century are the ones I haven't played.  We could quibble about placement but why?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Ffvii Remake better deliver

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"where is hollow knight yo, i didnt manage to play a third of half life 2 but i bothered to defeat every single boss in hollow knight"

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Thought this was a Top 20....skyrim above GOW....a buggy mess above a flawless, near perfection game. Another example of media overhyping shit"

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"How did you not put league of legends in the top 20 list, I mean it's def above warcraft at this point. Top played, top streamed, started e-sports. tons of clones."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Shadow of the colossus should be in that list in the top 5
Vrg4KlKnKoY,At least one Assassin's Creed game deserved the spot
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Resident evil 4 background music ?????
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Mario?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,This is really a list of best games? ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Was getting triggered Half Life not being there, then i saw the 1st. Now i can sleep in peace"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,where is need for speed and other gta games

Vrg4KlKnKoY,For me god of war is on the top 5
Vrg4KlKnKoY,MGS 5 over 3 or 4? Idk about that
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Sekiro and dark souls are made by the same company

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Cmon RDR2 should have been in top 10

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Uncharted 2 in 20? I stopped watching the video right there.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Let's be honest as much as I like doom 2016 I am happy it's not up here as much as my boy smash melee means to me
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Minecraft and dark souls should legitimately both be way higher on this list.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dragon age origins: am I a joke to you?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,COUGH Team Fortress 2 COUGH

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Can´t believe they didn´t mention at least one of the Assasins Creed saga.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Atleast one of the Assassin's Creed titles and Red Dead redemption 2 since the story for RDR2 was probably one of the best in history
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I’d say mw2 left a better legacy
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where's Blood Money that game is a classic
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Really RDR only gets a honorable mention 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,But WOW get like 17#

Vrg4KlKnKoY,where is my GTA san andreas
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Assassin’s Creed 2? How could they not even mention Ezio?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,"well I kinda highly disagree with GTA Online, it has just become big cash grab from Rockstar-Games"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Not even an honorable mention for any of the Pokemon games? I know Red/Blue/Yellow came out in the 90s, but many of their games were out this century."

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Cries in warhammer
Vrg4KlKnKoY,This flipped between the best games and most important games... There wasnt any consistency with the reasoning lmao
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red Dead Redemption 2...?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Not a single Assassin's Creed title ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,C'mon not even AC 2?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Im mad that no Assassins Creed games made it onto the list >:c
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Spider-Man PS4 or Red Dead Redemption 2 as an honorable mention?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,If the story was right mgsv would've been one of the masterpieces of the decade
Vrg4KlKnKoY,i thought borderlands was fun.....
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Devil May Cry. It is among the most famous Hack and Slash games of all time.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Resident evil 4??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Minecraft should have been Number 1, then Half-Life"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No CS:GO? you gotta be kidding me!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Not even an honorable mention for KOTOR. Wow.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,only red dead 2 and botw come close to the best game ever the witcher 3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,You know 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,God of war 4 is my number 1 game of the decade/century???
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where's Super Mario Galaxy 2?! I tought it would be number one...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2???
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What?! No assassin's creed?! it desereves a place in the list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is Assassin's creed ??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Halo will always be apart of me.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Master chief is my hero
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I know there is Bioshock in the list but because it refers to the best games of the century let me remind you of Deus ex...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Battlefield 3  ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Missing Okami and horizon zero Dawn. Number 1 certainly not my kind of game, but hey nice list"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Half life and portal are in the same universe so they kinda violate your rules
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Bloodborne ?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Assassins creed?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Mafia II?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No CS?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,2)DBZ BT3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,3 Kingdom Hearts 3
Vrg4KlKnKoY,F New Vegas ?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,c'on do you even game bruh
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red dead redemption 2? Anyone ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"it's a very good list but to be honest, red dead redemption should have been #1 because this game not only shows you the western world but also what it means to sacrifice everything for your family. Even the graphics looks like recent games but it was made 10 years ago"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,wtf Where's GTA San Andreas
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I paused right before number 1 and I can honestly say I think it will be fortnite
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I`d change the title of this list to most influential (or iconic) games since most of the games titles mentioned in this video were more impactful than great imo. I mean no Super Mario Galaxy 2, Bloodborne, Horizon: Zero Dawn and Mass Effect 2?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Shouldn't Horizon Zero Dawn be on this list?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,My Uncharted ??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I'm surprised San Andreas wasn't even mentioned!!!!! Wtf?!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,None of the persona games are on this list? that's a damn shame
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is DEVIL MAY CRY 5huh?tell me?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Why no Max Payne 3???

Vrg4KlKnKoY,It's a shame only few ppl onow leagu of legends and DotA 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,DotA cuz it started theoba gen

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is red dead redemption 2 ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I have played a lot, lot of games but none better than Red dead Redemption 2, the Protagonist of RDR 2 is the greatest protagonist I have ever played as, also Assassin's creed 2 should have been there, another nostalgic experience I will never forget, God of war 2 could have been there too, I agree with Halo Combat evolved and Witcher 3 though"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No okami or shadow of the colossus is an outrage
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Bioshock should be higher and halo 2 instead of combat evolved

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is fortnite? Hahah

Vrg4KlKnKoY,No assassins creed?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Assasins creed, fallout, nfs most wanted,...?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Gears of war was not even mentioned? It sparked third person cover shooters and the original trilogies story was phenomenal
Vrg4KlKnKoY,is assassin creed in the honorble mention “NOPE” what a let down
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I gotta say. I agree with this list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Assassin's Creed 4? Nowhere?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Wow, you know you’re in for a bad Top 20 when you see Uncharted Series at #20 and Dark Souls Series at #18. ?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,So TPP is #19 and MGS3 IS NOT EVEN ON THE LIST!!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Keep in mind that the large majority of games listed on this video are from the X360/PS3 era, and the first minority are the Ps2/Xbox/Gamecube era. Got to admit that the current, soon to end, generation has been very disappointing overall (except for a few games of course)."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,WM Next:
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Top 20 games of the 70s
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Top 20 games of the 80s
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Top 20 games of the 90s
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Wait, if you almost gave the 19th spot to the snake game, then why was the snake game not put at the 20th spot?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What the heck where is doom
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Final fantasy 7
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I wanted to see one of the Metroid Prime games represented. But ah well.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"""Enough lore to fill Stephen King-size novel"" well... there are like 9 books that this lore comes from..."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Do a video about C&C
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Disappointed that Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest did not even get honorable mentions. All a matter of taste after all.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Gears?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Top 10 Video Game Characters That Can Take On Armies
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Every once in a while I forget why I hate this channel. Then I see videos like this and I'm reminded of why.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Seriously no Assassin’s Creed 2 ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,So no Dota 2?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Thank God Arkham City is here.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Glad Halo got a high ranking though I wouldn’t have chosen CE. I’m  also surprised that Doom 2016 didn’t make the list, but whatever. Great vid you guys!"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,rd2?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Hollow knight is underrated. Really good indie studio doesn't get enough attention.

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Why no devil may cry
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Resident evil 4, God of war  And the last of us ,These are my favorite games in life."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,that resident evil 4 bgm still scares the shit outta me
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No bloodborne?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,World of Warcraft should be number 1 due to the addiction it caused and the 12 million players during wotlk
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Stardew valley???
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Hey watchmojo where the hell are uncharted 4 or red dead redemption 2, Assassin's creed blackflag. Just rename the title as you fav games of century, would make more sense."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Dota? Counter strike?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Wow is rank 17.... come on man
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"One game series I would like to lift forward, (although it's not fitting in this list) is the Metro series. Based on a novel Metro 2033 is amazing! A bit linear, but very dark atmosphere which does always remind you it's a horror game by making your pulse go up. You never knwo what to expect, the monster fights are extremely interesting, and instead of jsut being a run and gun game you can sneak and only shoot the monsters/people directly in your way. You have several choices to make, which award karma points which decide which ending you get (""good""/""bad"")"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No fallout??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,How are no assassin's creed games on this list?!! And what about GTA V?!!!!!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I am very proud to say that I have played and in many cases own all of these. 
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Also I don't know if I would have put Metal Gear Solid 5 on the list. Sure it was good but it had nothing on Metal Gear Solid 2 or 3 in terms of story or plot. And frankly the gameplay didn't really add that much to the genre. Same goes for GTA5. I would have replaced it with Red Dead Redemption.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I understand one gamer per franchise.....But cmon..No Counter Strike-1.6?????...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No regard for the countless LAN parties??!!
Vrg4KlKnKoY,u forgot about doom 1993
Vrg4KlKnKoY,WM: Let's forget Mortal Kombat ever even existed.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"GTA 5 is overrated, change my mind"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Hello prince of Persia trilogy?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,For real? Red dead redemption 2 is not even in the hounarble mentions
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is Assassin creed Series??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I don't like this 'one game per franchise' rule
Vrg4KlKnKoY,ok there is a half life 2 in that video but come on where is the half life???
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red dead 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where the hell is 'FAR CRY 3'
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Well Arma series starting from Operation Flashpoint deserve at least an honorable mention.Not stunning graphics but you feel like being part of a real battle, combining fps genre with strategic depth and carefull planning. Not to mention the extensive modding community."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Mafia 2 ????
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Not one Assassins Creed?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Left 4 dead
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Fallout new Vegas should've gotten a mention at least
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Last time I was this early, iron man was still alive"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Can't believe they didn't show throwing the can at the combine's face.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red dead 2
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is rdr2 to be honest
Vrg4KlKnKoY,If bioshock made the list then resistance should of also
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Skyrim is easily my favorite game ever. The game is endless. A perfect game.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Oldschool Runescape
Vrg4KlKnKoY,How about doom 2016
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Assassin's creed? persona 5? Pokemon series? final fantasy15? where are all these amazing games?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Assassins creed black flag??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,“That’s what you get!”
Vrg4KlKnKoY,“BOI...”
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red Dead Redemption 2 is best game ever made
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What about Far Cry
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Ok But where on earth is assassins creed 2 ????
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Souls shouldve been higher. but hey atleast they put it in the list.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I can't figure out your rules. Many games in another list you didn't mention like persona 5, metroid prime, fallout 3 and super Mario galaxy, but chose uncharted 2 and super smash brother?It's inconsistent."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"LOL at ""League Of Legends"" (pun intended), u mean the DOTA copycat right ?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where the flip is Mario?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3 hmmmm ok
Vrg4KlKnKoY,What is minecraft?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Honestly Watchmojo has gained great respect from me by putting Half-Life 2 at number 1. This entire list is really good compared to what Watchmojo usually puts out.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"HALO ON NUMBER 5!!!??? You dont even play videogames If you put Halo 5, im out not even end the list screw you wachtmojo"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Fing Bloomberg ads
Vrg4KlKnKoY,not even a mention for pokémon? so many people grew up on that game..

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Shocked that Metroid Prime or a 3D Mario game didn't make this list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,San andreas instead of V
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I will not put GTA:SA or GTA IV below GTA V.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Wheres's Tiberium Wars ?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Can someone someone summarize the video please?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,RE 4 is a timeless masterpiece
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Gta 5 instead of San Andreas ??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,rdr2 is my number 1
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Y’all could someone PLEASE explain to me the appeal of the Witcher 3? That’s not in a sarcastic tone I’m just confused, I have the game, but I just couldn’t get into it like I could with Skyrim or dragon age. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not bashing it at all, like I adore the game’s ost (that shit slaps tbh). Is it worth trying to get into it again?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where da hell is The Walking Dead?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,But both cod mw2 an bo2 were better than mw1 even for its time
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Not seeing GTA:SA and Crysis 1 at least makes me lose faith in this world every single day.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Most of these are new. Anachronox, Max Payne and Full Throttle should be on this list."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Spider-Man?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Seriously, Botw and wild hunt were at 2 and 3! What could possibly be better?!?"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Oh. Half life 2. I mean can’t really argue with that...
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Red dead and shadow of the colossus should have been on the list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Where is Red dead Redemption 2? That's a joke??
Vrg4KlKnKoY,This is unfair that gta 5 is on no8 the position of gta 5 is no 1 because it is most favorite game for all and legendary game most viewed game for all time
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Confident
Vrg4KlKnKoY,I think assassins creed 2 should have made the list
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"No Pokémon game, no Final Fantasy game, no Battle Royale game... interesting"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Majora's Mask?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Kicked off the century with a bang and holds up really damn well.
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"I knew this list was gonna be garbage when I saw uncharted 2 at 20 wtf, have you guys even played all these games,"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"No Mario odyssey,no shadow of the colossus, last of us on 9 etc.... it’s completely wrong."
Vrg4KlKnKoY,For my potato skyrim is the best.?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,doom?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No Super Mario Galaxy 2?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,No assassins creed  rdr2 or silent hill?

Vrg4KlKnKoY,Yo got a well deserved disklike
Vrg4KlKnKoY,"Were tf is mario odyssey and Zelda, last of us or gta should have been number 1"
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Uncharted 2 over 4!?
Vrg4KlKnKoY,ASSASSINS CREED 4:BLACK FLAG
Vrg4KlKnKoY,Im still waiting for Half Life 3.  Never lose hope.

1MenwQ5D_FI,3:33 That looks a hell of a lot like a game I used to play 24/7 when I was little named Gods War online
1MenwQ5D_FI,Can't wait for Gods and Monsters! i need a 1981 Clash of the Titans game!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Finally I may have found the cure to my insomnia... looping the audio from this video!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Bruh whats with all these bots saying ""hE sOuNds lIkE hE cAnT bE aRsEd"""
1MenwQ5D_FI,"The way he pronounces ""game"" is the weirdest thing ever."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Keanu: wake up...and wait for September to arrive
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I got sad when he said cyberpunk is coming out in april :,)"
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,When they need “more time” in 2020 just means ps5 release.
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm gonna have to disagree that Everwild's art direction is inspired by Breath of the Wild. Many of Rare's games have a cartoony look to them.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"They have come a long way, Mario 64 was the 1st of the sort i played, it was limited where you could go but was good for its time."
1MenwQ5D_FI,It feels like there's always tons of good rpg's coming not none ever comes out
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,It feels like there's always tons of good rpg's coming not none ever comes out
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""The entire Dragonball Saga"" I guess just screw the original series."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Well, Cyberpunk and Elden Ring are the Giants of this year baby "
1MenwQ5D_FI,My favorite developers in recent years
1MenwQ5D_FI,My pc can barely watch this video on my pc forget about playing it because my pc will blow up.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Omg assassin’s i hope it will rly come out andd animal crosssinggggggh ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,wtf is going on with this comment section!!? some rival paid a clickfarm in india or something!???
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying light 2 reminds me of the safe place in Zombieland ??
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""Brexit has taken Britain into a police state"". Oh really."
1MenwQ5D_FI,why are people being mean to Falcon about his voice?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"he has a monotone and chill kind of way of speaking,  but he is genuinely excited."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Great stuff and some awesome looking games to look forward to. As a lover of the fantasy RPG genre - I am especially looking forward to Elden Ring - very curious about it.
1MenwQ5D_FI,When they release elder scrolls six it might not even be worth talking about with the way Bethesda’s heading every chest you find there will probably be a premium fee to open it lol
1MenwQ5D_FI,I cannot wait fo bannerlord I been waiting since 2014 for this game ???
1MenwQ5D_FI,This guy sounds like ed helms ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"New Mount & Blade, nice, cant wait it! It is game with really great concept!"
1MenwQ5D_FI,ps. keep the good content up!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I love what dying light 2 is doing it will be soooooo fun for me I might make a lot of bad choices in the game just to see what happens
1MenwQ5D_FI,When a game is delayed it makes me feel like the company actually cares about quality
1MenwQ5D_FI,Based on the Mongol invasion of Japan? The one where they died in two typhoons and then gave up? Interesting concept I guess lol
1MenwQ5D_FI,I’m ready for dying light 2 :) the first one was sooo good
1MenwQ5D_FI,3:04??now I want to play botw again
1MenwQ5D_FI,"What happened to that special Dying Light online pvp mode, I saw a few content creators play it but not a peep about it since"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Me going into 2020 trying to limit the games I get
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020:  my men and I would like a word with you about your purse and your belongings
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,Delay dying light a whole year! Make it perfect like the first game
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm excited for Gods and Monsters. Still not a lot of info about it though.
1MenwQ5D_FI,This guy is bored by his own channel.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,It feels like there's always tons of good rpg's coming not none ever comes out
1MenwQ5D_FI,Thank you ! When does the EVERWILD come out?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""Entire Dragon Ball saga"". Literally skips the beginning of the story straight to the last 3 arcs."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Then you realize that Dying Light 2 has been postponed indefinitely. Lol.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Game: has cartoonish art style
1MenwQ5D_FI,Gameranx: Oooooh so it’s BOTW
1MenwQ5D_FI,Surprised “Good and Evil 2” isn’t on here.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"dying light 2 and cyberpunk look really really cool, but honestly i've never loved a game more than ghost of tsushima and i've only seen like a 10 min gameplay, this is gonna be an awsome year!"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Here's a game Everytime he says game take a drink.
1MenwQ5D_FI,SO happy you included Bannerlord :)
1MenwQ5D_FI,There's a game I spotted on the playstation store last night which I'm looking forward too it's called tempest it looks pretty good plus summoning a giant octopus to help you out in combat is a plus as well
1MenwQ5D_FI,I know it's not part of the theme of this video but I'm really looking forward to DOOM Eternal!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Elden Ring looks amazing!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,2077 is one of the key best games ever created! I cannot wait!
1MenwQ5D_FI,As cool as watchdogs looks...I cant help but feeling an excessive level of wack-ness
1MenwQ5D_FI,This guy is bored by his own channel.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dang I need to upgrade my PC!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I appreciate your straightforward and calming narrative ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,During the watch dogs part I thought of a game concept similar to it
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Where it was free roam city, gang style"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Build your character through missions, tasks, stealing, bounties, notoriety and money"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"But you could also build up a gang to help you. And you can put your resources into building each person in your gang, bigger and stronger the gang, the more you will run the city and earn. Put a little extra into building a couple guys and they become your right hand men. Some missions would ask u to bring 3 gang members, some ask for 10. You could customize each gang member differently. All out gang wars where u bring your gang to enemy turf and if you can wipe them out, you take their property. "
1MenwQ5D_FI,I’m expecting a bunch from Dying Light 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,Ima say this again! 
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dont mix consoles with pc on a top list! So tirred of people making top lists and mix consoles with pc! 
1MenwQ5D_FI,Stop it!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Watch Dogs <3
1MenwQ5D_FI,Thanks so much for compiling all these lists!
1MenwQ5D_FI,i´m mostly waiting for dying light 2! the first game is so good
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Am I the only one that was upset that Kakarot, keeps getting touted as “the entire dragon ball saga” despite the fact that it excludes the entire Dragon Ball saga! :("
1MenwQ5D_FI,Mass Effect is the best of the decision making games. Hope Dying light 2 has good mind boggling decisions to make
1MenwQ5D_FI,"these games are so real and beautiful ""D ""O"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"When he says ""entire"" dragon ball story, does he really mean that?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Cyberpunk 2077 I've been waiting for a very long time was spewing when they delayed it but if it means the game will be better then so be it
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""Mount and Blade Bannerlord"" Haha, I'll believe that when I see it."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Hold on... Is the assassin's Creed timeline going backwards like from early Paris to god damn vikings
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I love open world games! It gives me a great feeling of freedom!
1MenwQ5D_FI,It would be nice to have an open world mortal kombat game. It's been like 15 years
1MenwQ5D_FI,Imagine seeing 5 comments that cant be seen
1MenwQ5D_FI,I've been waiting for bannerlord
1MenwQ5D_FI,07:54:00 AM
1MenwQ5D_FI,doctor reid is that you?
1MenwQ5D_FI,other upcoming gems: games with gameplay that looks so seemless that you're simply just watching anime
1MenwQ5D_FI,omg watch dogs and cyber punk! im so hyped
1MenwQ5D_FI,I bet like 7 of these games wont even come out this year
1MenwQ5D_FI,"New flight simulator, glad you mentioned."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm so looking forward to VtMB2 !
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I'm especially excited about Dying Light 2, and for one specific reason.  The open world looks great, the fact that it's an established series is great, the graphics look great, the concept/story sounds fantastic , et cetera, but the thing that really excites me is the way it's being billed as having a real focus on a BRANCHING narrative, with visible, impactful, meaningful, measurable consequences that you actually experience and have to deal with during a good portion of the rest of your playthrough."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Im looking forward to these gyems
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""It could be worse, you've seen worse"" "
1MenwQ5D_FI,Lol nothing could be more true ;)

1MenwQ5D_FI,Yo what ever happened to BIOMUTANT from THQ Nordic???
1MenwQ5D_FI,I've been trying for a long time to enjoy first-person games but it hasn't worked much. Wolfenstein is one of the exceptions.
1MenwQ5D_FI,They keep comparing things to Breath of the Wild as if that was the first open world game in existence.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Keanu: wake up...and wait for September to arrive
1MenwQ5D_FI,Suggestion: Open World Mortal Combat. Lets use our environment in the fights!
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I hope Bannerlord gets the love it deserves. Warband was amazing and the mods even more so. Bannerlord is gonna insane
1MenwQ5D_FI,Can't wait to play one of those games on our 10 years old PC
1MenwQ5D_FI,"With the AC & WD being in the same uni, I'm worried Ubi will f*ck up both titles."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Everwild's on PC too
1MenwQ5D_FI,Gods & monsters look like the type of game i've been dreaming about since i was a kid!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I realllyyyyy love Kakarottt can’t wait to play it
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Honestly, only Cyber Punk really makes me want to part with cash. Some of the others might be okay, but they seem to have a real 'meh' feeling."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Everwild looks beautiful
1MenwQ5D_FI,I like the developer walktrough of Dying Light 2.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""microsoft owns rare at this point""? they've owned rare for almost 20 years...."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"This guys’ voice has zero enthusiasm or joy. He sounds so “over” narrating this video.  Also if ANY of these games gender lock you, I ain’t gonna buy them."
1MenwQ5D_FI,My excitement for cyberpunk went down after I found out it was a 1st person shooter
1MenwQ5D_FI,"game idea : ""[Bojutsu] - the last 1""...a pvc staff can be used to {carry water, slide down ropes} among other things as well..."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm so excited about Cyberpunk!!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Bannerlord and Cyberpunk. It's gonna be a great harvesting season!
1MenwQ5D_FI,After Assassins Creed Oddyssey the fall in Love with old Greece and made Gods & Monsters!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm most excited for the last of us part 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I'm still waiting on Biomutant.  Look it up even in the Xbox Store.  It's there, but it's stuck in development hell I'm guessing at this point with no release date."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying light 2 i realy cant wait for game
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Holy crap, this is gonna be a good year."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Vikings X assassins creed, sign me up!"
1MenwQ5D_FI,1.5x speed. You’re welcome
1MenwQ5D_FI,i would love an assassins creed with character customization
1MenwQ5D_FI,"You know, so many games since last year are being delayed. I guess they're getting scared to make another Anthem, BO4, and a 76 again"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I haven't heard of Elden Ring but it looks really good, and I'm excited for a new Assassins Creed game"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Seeing Bannerlord every year hehe
1MenwQ5D_FI,"lol, 2020.... starting off as bad at 2019 ended. zzzzzzzz"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""Entire Dragon Ball saga"". Literally skips the beginning of the story straight to the last 3 arcs."
1MenwQ5D_FI,?Wake me up when September Ends?
1MenwQ5D_FI,- Some punk probably.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Representing the tiny tiny fraction that had never heard of cyberpunk 2077 till this video ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,While i am very interested in Cyberpunk 2077 ~ i am actually looking forward more to & the most interested in & absolutely captivated by Ghost of Tsushima & so Ghost is my personal #1!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""Based on the Mongol invasion of Japan""? I thought that ended before the Mongols ships made it there(twice)? Are you just a Samurai mopping up shipwrecked Mongols?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Watch Bugs Legion!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Stick Bannerlord in a ""coming this year"" list and it instantly curses it into yet another years worth of delay."
1MenwQ5D_FI,is there a typo with the Cyberpunk release date mentioned in the video? I thought it was delayed from April 16th to September 17th.
1MenwQ5D_FI,love game called ( days gone ) really different
1MenwQ5D_FI,"a good open world game is ""Pulsar Lost Colony"" look it up"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Im still thinking of what i want to study next year. Im thinking between game devolepment or software engineer/ai business
1MenwQ5D_FI,Watch Dogs Legion will be available on the last day of the year December 31st 2020 new year's eve yeah so it is basically a 2021 game.
1MenwQ5D_FI,I came here to watch the upcoming game of flight simulator. Waiting in my cardboard cockpit.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dude im so hyped for Cyberpunk!!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I'd beyond good and evil 2 was coming out this year, it'll definitely be #1"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""fps gta"" yeah if that actually was the sell on C77 that would be disappointing af. Luckily it's biggest point is that it is gonna be an RPG"
1MenwQ5D_FI,wait is the elden ring release release year confirmed cuz I thought there was no info on it
1MenwQ5D_FI,Idk how I miss this one but I found it lets get the show on the road
1MenwQ5D_FI,you missed... This Land is My Land... just started playing it and its still in dev off steam but seems dam good so far
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Looking forward to to watch dogs legion ,Cyberpunk , And Elden ring"
1MenwQ5D_FI,GRRM just needs to stop doing extra things and finish up his book series already. ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Elden ring is what I'm most excited for
1MenwQ5D_FI,Cyberpunk got pushed back to fall of this year I might as well make it my first PS5 game kick off!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Your Breathtaking!
1MenwQ5D_FI,The Open World concepts in games has redefined gaming as we know it
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying Light 2 and Watch Dogs 3 are the games I am looking forward to playing the most and I hope they both hold out until the release of the new console generation.
1MenwQ5D_FI,".... ""Kakorah"" lol. Best mispronunciation. I'm not even mad."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Assasin's Creed: Star Wars
1MenwQ5D_FI,I cant say what I am excited for. Previews and hype up just dont sell the game for me. Ones the game is out and I can see gameplay and reviews I decide to buy
1MenwQ5D_FI,“Thru gyem play” 3:12
1MenwQ5D_FI,When elder scrolls six releases I'm going off the map
1MenwQ5D_FI,I can feel the energy. The Power of Atom. The vast space. Wait.... where is my Carrack?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"cutscenes & trailers mean nothing ... it,s like you, A BIG ZERO !"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I'm going to play none of them. My little brother sold my xbox, ex fiancee sold my ps4, and my pc is gone. all while I was on a ship."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Legit never heard of Cyberpunk, and I'm a hardcore gamer who plays all genres regularly."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I wasn't impressed with your summary of it.
1MenwQ5D_FI,And what about Animal Crossing New Horizons???
1MenwQ5D_FI,It’s almost harvesting season!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I just see Andy Bernard when watching this video
1MenwQ5D_FI,Damn I love gaming
1MenwQ5D_FI,YAY !!!  More microtransaction filled wallet drainers !!   :D
1MenwQ5D_FI,Elder scrolls 6 better be hood because I've been waiting since I was 8
1MenwQ5D_FI,"If the new assassins creed is anything like odyssey then I won’t even consider it, we need to get back to the original game mechanics. I want something more like ac revelations"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Suggestion: Open World Mortal Combat. Lets use our environment in the fights!
1MenwQ5D_FI,You missed Genshin Impact
1MenwQ5D_FI,8:22 ...wait... PlayStation 4....and 5?!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I always thought falcon sounded like Louis CK ????
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Come on guys, I know it's in the description, but recording  5 new seconds saying that cyberpunk has been delayed was too difficult?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,It took them 5 years to make the new Dying Light it’s gonna be a perfection is the zombie genre
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying light got very little love for how great it was
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I really hope that Watch Dogs Legion have a one-story or few that I can actually understand and follow. I was pretty upset with Watch Dogs 2. I felt Watch Dogs 2 was more based on just creating chaos and I guess that's what the whole gist of that was about. But I felt like Watch Dogs 1 actually had something that I can follow it kind of gave me a reason why to create chaos and great madness throughout the city so hopefully Legion, follows what the first one did and it keep me intrigued. I don't mind  action and things blowing up but just give me a reason why this is necessary."
1MenwQ5D_FI,New subbie here. Xoxo from Hawaii. ? ? ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,omg is this ANDY FROM THE OFFICE
1MenwQ5D_FI,Just waiting for dying light 2 lol

1MenwQ5D_FI,"Cyperpunk has been delayed, hence no longer April release. Might wanna make a disclaimer about that."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Bruh was Falcon forced to make this video? Sounds like he did it in bed?? Love Dis dude
1MenwQ5D_FI,"ew, cyberpunk on stadia. No thanks from me."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I’m looking forward to resident evil 3
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Wont put Elder Scrolls on the list cause it wont see an actual release this year, but yet puts 3 other games in the list that wont release this year either."
1MenwQ5D_FI,KSP2 Hello! The openest of all.

1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed

1MenwQ5D_FI,Man I was looking forward to Dying Light 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,The fact Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga isn't on this list makes me question humanity

1MenwQ5D_FI,"For dying light 2; get it right and take your time, it has infinite possibilities and could be a match for Skyrim and GTA 5"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Here I am. Still playing The Witcher 3.?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Elden ring, take my money, give me a world to get lost in, transaction guaranteed."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Everwild and Cyberpunk on switch would be great.
1MenwQ5D_FI,So literally every game that got delayed huh? ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,No mention of Beyond Good & Evil 2 for this year!?  My biggest hope!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I need ghost of Tsushima right after hearing it was from creators of infamous
1MenwQ5D_FI,Um why is there so many bots saying he sounds like he can’t be arsed and 2020: the year of delayed games.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Dying Light 2 and Gods and monsters have my ears perked up!! Speaking of cartoon based games, I am surprised you didn't mention Baldo! That deserves a nod, although still unsure of its release date."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I need to finish Assassin's Creed 2, brotherhood, and Odyssey. I've played every other Assassin's Creed game. I also need to get into Skyrim more and finish Prey."
1MenwQ5D_FI,The narrator sounds very bored of his job. Made me stop watching the video after a minute
1MenwQ5D_FI,world of war craft console.... imagine :(
1MenwQ5D_FI,Go to AA. It’s just sad when you show up to work drunk.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Mount and Blade 2 will be awesome!!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"The first was a lot of fun, but very very rough... this is looking to be a lot more refined!!"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Hope they streamline a lot of things like menus and such, and focus on smoothing movements, hit boxes and huds."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Ghost of Tsushima release REVEALED today in Playstation Story Trailer - June 26, 2020"
1MenwQ5D_FI,It's almost harvesting season!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I wish i have ps4 or powerful pc to play those games :(
1MenwQ5D_FI,God and monster's! Will need this on my switch due to Zelda being delayed ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dbz kakarot would have been amazing if it started from him as a kid to the buu saga
1MenwQ5D_FI,you missed on Microsoft flight simulator ;) this is going to be a massive game changer.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Activision tennis ? 1977 can't wait to play it again. ???

1MenwQ5D_FI,"Cyber punk...... First time I've personally heard of it. Sure from what I saw, 1rst person GTA...... But does anyone else get an Acira vibe. Ya know...... That 80's anime. Like the First major anime film. Had that look about it. Just saying"
1MenwQ5D_FI,ghost of tsushima and CP 2077 are all I'm looking forward to this year. They will own my time when they drop
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Can't wait for a new Assassins Creed, it'll probably be let down for me but still, I've always played every AC game."
1MenwQ5D_FI,honestly i just want a kotor remake but its like fallen order where its hack n slash but also great story.
1MenwQ5D_FI,I don't know about the others but I have a feeling that Dying Light 2 will turn out better than Cyberpunk 2077.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying Light 2 is my number one.
1MenwQ5D_FI,GoT and Cyberpunk are two heavy hitters for this year.  I want to play Monsters and Gods as well.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"""the mark that zelda breath of the wild left on the gaming world"" i shall never buy a game similar to it. i love zelda, dislike breath of the wild."
1MenwQ5D_FI,@gameranx what is the name of the artist and track playing in the beginning of this video ... please and thank u

1MenwQ5D_FI,"There’s also another Beyond Good and Evil coming, but no idea when that’s going to be dropped."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Now THAT's what I call a fully motivated narrator....
1MenwQ5D_FI,"breath of the wild like artstyle.... I don't know, yes, you are right at some point but a lot of people seem to forget about Dauntless. The monster hunter style game. "
1MenwQ5D_FI,It has this exact kind of artstyle and was before breath of the wild. Just mentioning ^^
1MenwQ5D_FI,I need to speak with you.
1MenwQ5D_FI,4:03 This Medusa Really put a smilee on my face
1MenwQ5D_FI,I can't wait for Gods and Monsters. Greek Mythology is my jam so I'm gonna love it
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm just calling it AC2020 until I get something solid on the whole Ragnarok thing
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I got sad when he said cyberpunk is coming out in april :,)"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Bruh whats with all these bots saying ""hE sOuNds lIkE hE cAnT bE aRsEd"""
1MenwQ5D_FI,It feels like there's always tons of good rpg's coming not none ever comes out
1MenwQ5D_FI,Great video dude!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"My favorite thing about games these days is the anticipation, but when I actually own a game and play it I'm bored so quickly, I used to love gaming and I think there are many great games out there, but after I didn't game for years because of several reasons I can't seem to get into it anymore, can anyone please give me some advice on how to fall back in love with gaming again"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Dying light is one I'm waiting for, fs. Can't wait"
1MenwQ5D_FI,hello sir can i use any game trailer like you for my youtube channel with my hindi commentary
1MenwQ5D_FI,I always like Falcons take on these games. These are always good summaries that really help me plan my game buys for the coming year. Thank you Gameranx and Falcon! ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,they all look really good...but i been waiting for cyberpunk lol
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Just cause some of the games listed here took the “cartoon” graphics route, doesn’t mean that it’s directly inspired or copied from BOTW. You act as if BOTW was the first ever cartoon-like game"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Been waiting for ghost of tushima since 2018
1MenwQ5D_FI,Bannerlord when?
1MenwQ5D_FI,11:01 u forgot about the original mirrors edge?
1MenwQ5D_FI,3:52 looks like a fortnite character
1MenwQ5D_FI,Cyberpunk out in September now. I feel that in the core of my soul.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Damn...my pockets are crying right now
1MenwQ5D_FI,10:55 There are plenty of us that have never heard of the game. Don't make the mistaken assumption that everyone has heard of it or knows what it is. And no not everyone has been on the edge of their seats waiting for the game (especially those of us who have near heard of it). I personally have been waiting for Pantheon Rise of the Fallen.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Wow. Cyberpunk looks good.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Mark my words, cyberpunk will not live up to its hype!"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Hacker resistance? So at least 2/3 playable characters are morbidly obese.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Beyond good and evil2:(
1MenwQ5D_FI,Say intriguing again...
1MenwQ5D_FI,No botw 2? ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,The guy narrating sounds drunk ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Was this video delayed? What with the April release date already having been pushed back a while now.
1MenwQ5D_FI,The way he says GAMES sometimes gets me and he sounds like Andy Bernard from The Office
1MenwQ5D_FI,Assassin's Creed needs to take a 2 year break... I can't stand hearing about it anymore...
1MenwQ5D_FI,Then I go see the footage it's the same stupid thing from the last 23 previous ones...
1MenwQ5D_FI,"If the series will never evolve, please, simply give us a break, even for the ones who likes it to miss it..."
1MenwQ5D_FI,Spellbreaker seems interesting
1MenwQ5D_FI,Where's Skyrim Gucci Toilet Edition
1MenwQ5D_FI,This video is pretty useful!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"You lost me mostly when you said Msft basically owns Rare these day... or ya know, the last 20 years.  And then you talk about DBZ Kakarot and ignore that it's the Dragonball story being told... again... for the third time.  Very surprised you have 5.4 M subs."
1MenwQ5D_FI,The game delays this year have been absolutely astonishing. I am really stoked for Ghosts since its coming out the soonest and looks pretty amazing.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Simple fun xd
1MenwQ5D_FI,whats with your pronunciation lol MON-GO-LEE-IN + YUH-KOO-ZUH not yokuza and mongalin
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he haven’t slept in a year. Or he wants to die?
1MenwQ5D_FI,wOw ThAnKs FoR tHe LiKeS gUyS
1MenwQ5D_FI,Sims4 still no open worlds . Paralives coming will be a open world ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Me already knowing that GTA VI wasn’t going to be on here because Rockstar is taking forever. ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Glad to see Kakarot on here!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Makes you feel like 'generic open-world protagonist'.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Another a great number of games that will be impossible for me to play with my trash computer
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Which one episode of what in Dragonball should I watch to showcase why it’s great and to see if I’ll like the anime and games, and where can I watch it? Thanks ?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Cries in sims 4
1MenwQ5D_FI,y'all are forgetting KSP 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,"We've been waiting for Cyberpunk 2077 for so long, that it seems it might release in 2077"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"It's ""traversal"" not ""transversal"""
1MenwQ5D_FI,he sounds like Ed Helms
1MenwQ5D_FI,Sleeping dogs 2 please revive that game ?
1MenwQ5D_FI,I don’t think you did many of these games justice. Appreciate the list nonetheless.
1MenwQ5D_FI,I was sooooo mad when I first found out this Ghost Of Tsushima was ps4 only I’m mainly Xbox but I’m literally buying a PS4 only for for Ghost Of Tsushima
1MenwQ5D_FI,Most excited for dying light 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,"So this is one of two videos now where they claim that Elden Ring is coming this year. Where does this info come from? If it's just a rumor, whycome u no say RUMOR 4?? "
1MenwQ5D_FI,"---I have grudgingly begun to accept that (apparently) most people aren't as hyped about ER as I am since, with even this little bit of info, the world isn't a zillion percent fapping themselves over hearing the words ""Elden Ring will be released some time in 2020"". I feel like the one guy who stands up and claps so loud it hurts his hands, only to realize seconds later that NO ONE else is clapping but only starring and waiting for him to sit the F down. Nothing in the Friday News show where Jake says ""oh btw, we said Elden Ring is coming this year, but it might not be, so plz don't urinate."" Some acknowledgement please good sirs! "
1MenwQ5D_FI,Satisfactory from coffee stain studios is my 2020 open world addiction
1MenwQ5D_FI,"wow Gods anr Monsters, Everwild looks so beautiful and so cool ! and of course Cyberpunk !!  Gost of Tsushima promise to be a great game too !"

1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,2020: The year of delayed games
1MenwQ5D_FI,"M&B2 and Cyberpunk, once I get my hands on one of those, every other game goes on a very long lets play waiting list.  Good list btw"
1MenwQ5D_FI,ALL OF THEM!
1MenwQ5D_FI,I feel like if rocksteady would’ve made the entire Batman trilogy maps playable in like after you complete Arkham knights story you can go around the asylum and in Arkham city and in Wayne manor/ the bat cave it would be so enjoyable
1MenwQ5D_FI,I want to play so many games but I haven't played any thing. I need to save up.
1MenwQ5D_FI,DBZ kakarot failed EVERY expectation and was about as deep as a puddle.
1MenwQ5D_FI,I'm really hyped for biomutant
1MenwQ5D_FI,You say cyberpunk is coming April 16th even tho in the video you can see the date being September 17th ( Wich is the correct one )
1MenwQ5D_FI,The narrator sound miffed and over it. I wonder how much this dude gets paid to do these videos. I wish i could get paid for narrating video game videos on YouTube. I would sound much chipper than this wet blanket
1MenwQ5D_FI,i'll tell you when dying light 2 is coming out.....next gen
1MenwQ5D_FI,Is Atomic Heart ever coming out? Seemed like a really interesting concept
1MenwQ5D_FI,I hope Gods and Monsters will turn out to be good. I love mythology (especially when I'm greek and danish/norse) and always thought we lacked in videogames when it comes to it. Come on ubisoft... please make it good.
1MenwQ5D_FI,you forget Plague Inc.
1MenwQ5D_FI,untity: Hmm i wonder what we should base our new assasins creed on
1MenwQ5D_FI,in lunch break
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Who else is really picky at what games they play, I’m more into open world games like gta and rdr2 or the far cry series"
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,This guy is bored by his own channel.
1MenwQ5D_FI,As someone who plays xbox one I appreciate this video having games for console
1MenwQ5D_FI,Why isn’t anyone talking about dying light 2 ?

1MenwQ5D_FI,Yo what’s that soundtrack
1MenwQ5D_FI,I was just waiting for Lego Star Wars to be said somewhere on this list and was left sad
1MenwQ5D_FI,Dying Light 2 should be in TOP 5 or Number 1
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."

1MenwQ5D_FI,Does 2019 - 2020 count

1MenwQ5D_FI,Watch dogs could be like 6 underground

1MenwQ5D_FI,Dyning light 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Yes ghosts of tsushima looks beautiful, but it also looks like it applies the batman games POV. Where half the screen is taken up by your own character :/"

1MenwQ5D_FI,"final fantasy 7 will be open world once all the parts get released,.. i would also argue that no more heroes is not an open world game,. its an open level game but not open world,. Xenoblade chronicles 2 is open world for comparison,."

1MenwQ5D_FI,What game was in the thumbnail
1MenwQ5D_FI,Is it weird that I kind of want to see a ww1 era assassins creed game?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I feel like games always come to a point where graphics don’t get better (they’re still good), until the next Game from Rockstar launches and one year after every game has better graphics"
1MenwQ5D_FI,You didn't mention Atomic Hearts
1MenwQ5D_FI,laughs in poor
1MenwQ5D_FI,Anyone else noticing how weird this comment section is? I know it’s
1MenwQ5D_FI,Bots but it’s just odd to see.
1MenwQ5D_FI,It’s VERY SAD to see people not appreciating Elden ring as much as the other games
1MenwQ5D_FI,I didn't know cyber punk. I stopped gaming for few years
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Rainbow six quarantine ,gods and monsters and watch dogs was delayed after ghost recon breakpoint to an unknown date somewhere in 2021 2022 and you being a “gaming” channel not knowing that is hilarious"

1MenwQ5D_FI,Gods and Monsters ...  I feel like you can't touch Greek mythology after God of War. They owned the idea and they still do. Everything else will feel like a knock-off.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Ahhhhhh, what's the background music? Piano is good"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Combat was so ass in Mount & Blade. So buggy and glitchy. That game was so bad even on ps4.

1MenwQ5D_FI,Can't wait for Digimon survive
1MenwQ5D_FI,too many ads for me to watch this lame video
1MenwQ5D_FI,When I hear a game being delayed I think good I’d rather have a game that took 6 years to make close to perfect then something you can tell it needs more time then what it received (cough cough) watch dogs and a few others
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Bruh whats with all these bots saying ""hE sOuNds lIkE hE cAnT bE aRsEd"""
1MenwQ5D_FI,Really hit that “have dove” hard. Yeesh.

1MenwQ5D_FI,Assassins creed ww2?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Liked simply because I did not expect bannerlord to make it although it definitely deserves to be on this list. Thanks for noticing good under the radar games.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"The way 'Dying Light 2' is described, imagine it turning out more interesting than ""CyberPunk""... I think people shouldn't underestimate the potential of ""DL2""."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"1st person does not belong in action adventure.Goldeneye,perfect dark or gun games in general is where that belongs."

1MenwQ5D_FI,No Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga? I heard it’s open world.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Why is Pokemon Crown and Spectre not included? That game is going to be the ultimate highlight of 2020!

1MenwQ5D_FI,"7:38 Bobbies haven't needed Brexit to enforce the Police State. They are already using (badly programmed) facial recognition AI on the street, and CS gas instead of the more humane pocket sand. Thankfully, most of us at least aren't Brazilian, and we don't wear aggressive denim."

1MenwQ5D_FI,My cousin is actually working on Cyberpunk dev & wont tell me shit about it.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Oh god watch dogs legion looks like it will be a MESS from what we saw in the gameplay demo

1MenwQ5D_FI,Assasin's Creed Ragnarok
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Another one not mentioned here is Genshin Impact for mobile, switch, ps4 and pc."

1MenwQ5D_FI,calling vtmb2 not open world because it has hubs lol

1MenwQ5D_FI,harvesting season is almost upon us boys.
1MenwQ5D_FI,"The delay of cyberpunk until September is a bummer, but it gave me a reason to start witcher 3 from scratch. Not a terrible trade off"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Im pretty sure the next botw is coming out this year
1MenwQ5D_FI,So many new games can’t chose wat one I want more
1MenwQ5D_FI,"11:12 You said CyberPunk 2077 was releasing in April--but it's been pushed to September (17th?), FYI."
1MenwQ5D_FI,I dont know what to buy. Dragon ball or watch dogs... Help me out please
1MenwQ5D_FI,I’ll buy and play them all
1MenwQ5D_FI,Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed. The game was previously expected on April 16; now it won't launch until Sept. 17
1MenwQ5D_FI,why does he always sound hammered?

1MenwQ5D_FI,None of these games look good....
1MenwQ5D_FI,Why no mention of Skull and Bones?
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Star Citizen is worth mentioning, even if the full game isn't ready yet. Nice video otherwise, thanks"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Boycott all triple a titles until they shape up!
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I put ~750 hours in Odyssey.  I think I'll like Ragnarok, but I vow to not do that many hours again."

1MenwQ5D_FI,im sad to say that he didnt have monster islands elemental legends from roblox on here...
1MenwQ5D_FI,"I'm super excited for watch dogs legion, and that assassin's Creed game if that's gonna be a thing, as I'm a massive WD and AC fan. And cyberpunk looks cool too."
1MenwQ5D_FI,"And I'll prob be buying Lego Star wars the Skywalker saga when that is released this year, mostly for nostalgia, but it also looks kinda cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,the new flight simulator is the most realistic ever. It's the kind of game that you will want an entire specific gaming setup. It's the kind of game you build a whole new system just to run it.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Any continued faith in Bethesda is literally unhealthy.
1MenwQ5D_FI,the only two open worlds i am waiting for : cyberpunk and tsushima
1MenwQ5D_FI,Guys anyone thinking when gonna come ps5
1MenwQ5D_FI,God and monsters looks really Nice.

1MenwQ5D_FI,Cannot describe how excited I am for Animal Crossing
1MenwQ5D_FI,see's Gods and Monsters
1MenwQ5D_FI,Me: Wooo ? that looks cool I can't wait to play that
1MenwQ5D_FI,Him: made by Ubisoft 
1MenwQ5D_FI,Me: why do I hear micro transactions themed Boss music?
1MenwQ5D_FI,Why does the thumbnails always look better than the games in the video for these type of videos smh
1MenwQ5D_FI,What about borderlands 3
1MenwQ5D_FI,"An Assassins Creed set in Nazi Germany, in between the wars would be so cool."
1MenwQ5D_FI,He sounds like he can’t be arsed
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Real ""enthusiastic"" about these upcoming titles uh?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,Can we just have falcon do all the voice overs? I dont wanna offend the other ppl but falcons voice just isnt annoying. Maybe thats just me shrugs
1MenwQ5D_FI,I doubt we see fs 2020 idky i think they will decide not to release until at best end of 4th qtr just to meet title name or early 2021.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Watch dogs abd cyberpunk for me...... Though want ELDER scrolls 6
1MenwQ5D_FI,I don’t like the cartoon character esthetic. About 95 percent of Apple App Store games have it also. For me it destroys the immersion factor. I think it can be traced to anime.
1MenwQ5D_FI,Trully! bad ice cream 3 on hudgames has great graphics!
1MenwQ5D_FI,Whatever happened about that game called “wild” for ps4
1MenwQ5D_FI,fock yakuza like dragon could be really good if it wasnt turn based game
1MenwQ5D_FI,The bloke using speakers not getting me
1MenwQ5D_FI,you forgot biomutant witch should be the 2nd or 3rd best lol
1MenwQ5D_FI,"Video still says Cyberpunk 2077 release date is April 16, (sadly not) description says September 17... wut?"
1MenwQ5D_FI,For me i'm particularly excited as hell for these 3 only:
1MenwQ5D_FI,1. Elden ring. 
1MenwQ5D_FI,2. Dying Light 2
1MenwQ5D_FI,3. Ghost of Tsushima(even though I don't have a ps4 lol)
1MenwQ5D_FI,What about Sons of the Forest?
1MenwQ5D_FI,I wish we had more medieval open world games. Imagine a well thought out GoT sandbox. 
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"So no one has done this, so i will. Here goes:"
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,0:52 #25 Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,1:37 #24: Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,2:21 #23 Need for Speed Heat
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,This list made me question your credibility.
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Gamingbolt staff have been on the bong water again..
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"No Outer Worlds, no Fire Emblem, no Remnant. The divison 2 at 3, Kingdom Hearts and Gears 5 above DMC5?"
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"“Number 5, Gears 5”"
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Cheeky.
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Putting The Division 2 at #3 ruined what credibility you had.
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Days gone?  Underrated game and best open world game for me of the year and I’m not the only one
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"""Hmm yes, its time i complain about the list not having a game i want even though i havent played most of the games here"""
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Wtf is this at 14:44 just an image? And only like 10 seconds talking about DMC5 without mentioning anything about the gameplay? Take my dislike for the disrespect.
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,And where the hell are the outer worlds   and fire emblem three houses???
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Three Houses where!?
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"Why is fire emblem three houses not on the list at all? While I do appreciate the video and thank you all for great contents as always, I do feel like this list is missing a few good titles..."
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,The Outerworlds and Days Gone are definitely among the best 25 games of the year lol
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"No Outer Worlds, but The Division is #3? Wtf, but I'm glad Judgment's finally gettin' love too."
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Fire Emblem not even mentioned when it won fan game of the year
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,"Biggest highway robbery of this year is the game called ""Bloodstained ritual of the night."""
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,That game is the true successor for one of the ALL TIME best side scrolling video game ever in Castlevania symphony of the night.
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Remedy has always been ahead of its time....wheather its max payne or alan wake
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Why the dmc 5 only shows a image ?!
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,Finishing Sekiro was honestly one of the worst things I have done. 
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,I can't go into it blind again! I want to reexperience that game from zero soooooo badly!
Ei7ZtO5qYgo,I'm surprised Days Gone didn't make the list. Then again I'm not. 
DYrrWSd9bFk,That butt physics
DYrrWSd9bFk,Too much cinematic trailers these days..
DYrrWSd9bFk,I'm not really excited for the majority of these games.
DYrrWSd9bFk,"These are just cinematic, when you see the gameplay will be totally different."
DYrrWSd9bFk,"41:39 “L’Oréal, cause you’re worth it”"
DYrrWSd9bFk,I don't care how many video's I see of Death Standing. I still have no idea what its about.
DYrrWSd9bFk,00:00 Project EVE 02:02 Oddworld Soulstorm 03:15 Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order 
DYrrWSd9bFk,05:06 The Elder Scrolls Online: Elsweyr 
DYrrWSd9bFk,07:04 Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 
DYrrWSd9bFk,08:16 Warcraft III: Reforged 
DYrrWSd9bFk,Darkborn actually looks really cool. There needs to be more games where you play as the monster.
DYrrWSd9bFk,I want to smoke what the people smoked when they created death stranding
DYrrWSd9bFk,06:59:00 AM
DYrrWSd9bFk,"""So your finally awake"""
DYrrWSd9bFk,"BG&E2 and Cyberpunk have my favorite trailers. Idk about gameplay, but the trailers are fun."
DYrrWSd9bFk,6:00 Jzargo is done talking.
DYrrWSd9bFk,RIP MY GT 730 2GB
DYrrWSd9bFk,"Too many cinematic cutscenes, and in the end most will end up shipping as button mashing mindless-action power-fantasy QTE scourged garbage straight into gaming oblivion."
DYrrWSd9bFk,NOTE: Death Stranding will come to PC.
DYrrWSd9bFk,Darkborn looks like Skyrim from the dragons point of view
DYrrWSd9bFk,"if the armor on your ass literally jiggles in the wind, probably just dont worry about wearing armor lol."
DYrrWSd9bFk,34:10 best one for me
DYrrWSd9bFk,30:29 who else noticed Gaz/Ghost's voice from CoD?
DYrrWSd9bFk,I don’t like how all games are set in the future!!
DYrrWSd9bFk,why was “control” so similar to infamous second son ? I’ve been waiting so long for a sequel
DYrrWSd9bFk,6:05 cool different creature interaction
DYrrWSd9bFk,???? ? ??? ????? ?????
DYrrWSd9bFk,Lol Star Citizen ain't coming out until 2034
DYrrWSd9bFk,18:14 I heard the N word?
DYrrWSd9bFk,???? ??...???...?????
DYrrWSd9bFk,1:46 as she comes in her bum bouncing omg
DYrrWSd9bFk,"Doom Eternal? I’ve preordered it, and played the demo. It’s gonna be the best game of 2020"
DYrrWSd9bFk,Just waiting for Ellies Return
DYrrWSd9bFk,Good video! I'm liked and share 657 times :D
DYrrWSd9bFk,i can tell you started to run out of games when you put star citizen on this list. At least you are optimistic for a 2020 release
DYrrWSd9bFk,You need to include watch dogs legion and Avengers.
DYrrWSd9bFk,where's the sinking city?
DYrrWSd9bFk,? I can't wait
DYrrWSd9bFk,The girl eating the bug ???
DYrrWSd9bFk,wanna know what I find tragic about a lot of these games? no option to choose 1st or 3rd person perspective! what a shame! great vid though :)
DYrrWSd9bFk,The majority of these look pretty lame.
DYrrWSd9bFk,Good video! I'm liked and share 595 times :D
DYrrWSd9bFk,I- euhm I thought elder scrolls 6 was coming out? ?
DYrrWSd9bFk,Control looks interesting and Gost of Tsushima too 
_pGfUwgbHKk,I have a video idea
_pGfUwgbHKk,Top 10 Rip off games that are much better than original
_pGfUwgbHKk,"To be fair though, NOVA was pretty fun. Especially NOVA 3"
_pGfUwgbHKk,How is Rock Band a rip-off if it is made by the same developer as Guitar Hero?
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Hey mom, can we get Halo"
_pGfUwgbHKk,"          No, honey, we have Halo at home."
_pGfUwgbHKk,Nothing could compete with Grand Theft Auto?!
_pGfUwgbHKk,Laughs in Simpsons:Hit & Run
_pGfUwgbHKk,Every mobile GameLoft release
_pGfUwgbHKk,Saints row had much more customization both player/vehicle options from crotch areas and making a custom semi truck cab
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Dante’s inferno was a gameplay rip off of GoW but that’s it, the rest was it’s own thing"
_pGfUwgbHKk,Rip N.O.V.A 3
_pGfUwgbHKk,2012-2017
_pGfUwgbHKk,"When most of the ""original"" games listed are ripoffs themselves. ?"
_pGfUwgbHKk,Have you heard of “Brawlhalla” :)
_pGfUwgbHKk,13:59 You mean Dante from DMC? I'm pretty much sure the name Dante came from Dante Aligheiri himself which is portrayed as the main protagonist in Dante's Inferno
_pGfUwgbHKk,"N.O.V.A 3 was literally my whole childhood, and is the best game of all time. I used to play it for hours with my cousins."
_pGfUwgbHKk,"From what I can tell, the majority of knockoffs here exist to fill a void. Mainly for mobile."
_pGfUwgbHKk,"For GTA ripoffs, the mobile ""Gangstar"" series are pretty good"
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Speaking of Legend of zelda rip-off what happened to ""tunic"" it was announced on last year E3. I did want that (I still do)"
_pGfUwgbHKk,"This should be called “biggest copycats in gaming history” or something. Most of these games are just cheaper alternatives, and if that’s what you’re looking for is it really a rip off ?"
_pGfUwgbHKk,So we’re just gonna ignore the fact that she farted in her combo in 10:35
_pGfUwgbHKk,What about Bubsy 1 and 2 based on the Sonic The Hedgehog series?
_pGfUwgbHKk,What about Dauntless being a bad rip off of Monster Hunter.
_pGfUwgbHKk,"yes, Ocean horn is exactly like Zelda, but there is no Zelda for Mobile and the game is actually very good"
_pGfUwgbHKk,Finally someone said something about oceanhorn! The second one is even more of a ripoff. I beat it already and it’s scary close to Legend of Zelda.
_pGfUwgbHKk,"""Dante's Inferno is a ripoff of GoW"""
_pGfUwgbHKk,Ever heard of Hero of Sparta?
_pGfUwgbHKk,6:10 lol he just slaps him in the cheek and he oof
_pGfUwgbHKk,"N.O.V.A,looks like Crysis with Halo gameplays"
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Well some of them are actually good like Dantes inferno I played it on psp, it's not a god of war clone game mechanics are not similar. Nowadays is nothing original anymore."
_pGfUwgbHKk,Me: Seed Halo and Gamelofts Nova series..
_pGfUwgbHKk,Also me: WOW really?
_pGfUwgbHKk,Temple Run is a rip-off of Pepsiman
_pGfUwgbHKk,Nova was my childhood
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Rock band was great, loved singing and drumming at the same time."
_pGfUwgbHKk,Damn I vividly remember playing castle miner z and nova 3????
_pGfUwgbHKk,"""Prototype"", based on ""inFamous"""
_pGfUwgbHKk,Rock Band isn't remotely a rip-off....also it's a billion times better than Guitar Hero.
_pGfUwgbHKk,You could make this video with only Gameloft rip-offs. That's the only thing they do.
_pGfUwgbHKk,Did anyone even notice the fact that the Oceanhorn character's outfit literally looks like the champions tunic from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
_pGfUwgbHKk,Had NOVA. impeccable graphics for a phone
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Love how it says rockband failed, yet they are still adding songs to the game on a regular basis ?"
_pGfUwgbHKk,I have nova on my phone and it's awesome. One of my favorite free phone shooters. Good campaign and co op
_pGfUwgbHKk,“Pump It Up” franchise is a rip-off of “Dance Dance Revolution” franchise and both are still going on even to this day. Both use the dance pad to play the game even if they are different. Konami filed the law suit against Andamiro (creator of Pump It Up franchise)
_pGfUwgbHKk,Nova 3 was amazing though i know when i was 11 and finished the game i felt so great i mean there wasnt a halo game for your phone so nova did the job
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Anyone else thinking of Harvest Moon on Nintendo GameBoy back in the 90's, when it comes to farming games? :P"
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Heres another one, Genshin Impact - TLOZ Breath of the Wild"
_pGfUwgbHKk,In my childhood whenever I was able to defeat clown in Fighter History! man that was a great game.
_pGfUwgbHKk,There’s a difference between ripoff and inspiration
_pGfUwgbHKk,Does any one know the name of that song on part 2:16 am running from u from rock band the game
_pGfUwgbHKk,"warz and dayz LOL, are u dumb? one has nothing to do with the other... clearly he never played any of them."
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Another interesting fact about ""The WarZ"" i actually played it. and the game admin played too... and cheated. they spawned in weapons for themselves and their friends. and it was near possible to kill them. and when the players got fedup with this they started cheating to. and got outright banned for it."
_pGfUwgbHKk,Why is nobody talking about the fact that she farted in her combo at 10:35 I'm starting to think the game was never meant to release and weas just for comedic purpose XD
_pGfUwgbHKk,What about RULES OF SURVIVAL and PUBG?
_pGfUwgbHKk,Who dares disrespect Saints Row?
_pGfUwgbHKk,"What about Dark Souls, a ripoff version of Severance: Blade of Darkness."
_pGfUwgbHKk,Ocean horn literally says it took inspiration From zelda
_pGfUwgbHKk,That music from Giana Sisters is basically the soundtrack to my childhood :-)
_pGfUwgbHKk,10:36 ummmm ok buddy
_pGfUwgbHKk,12:13 more Mario why
_pGfUwgbHKk,Nova was actually kinda fun
_pGfUwgbHKk,I'm channeling my inner Angry Joe when i say FOUR HOURS to respawn?
_pGfUwgbHKk,But lego dimensions came and you didnt put that on the list
_pGfUwgbHKk,"Look I haven’t watched the video yet but damn, how tf you gonna call N.O.V.A. a rip-off? That was the best damn mobile shooter out there, it and Infinity Blade are the best mobile games and they haven’t made anything to top them since ?"
_pGfUwgbHKk,you forgot to put  Mobile legends in this video
_pGfUwgbHKk,base on League of Legends 
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Uhh we forgot Control.

tLzp_xUr-gQ,"How can you make a ""TOP XX"" video, that contains games you've never actually played? How? You can't rank something you've never experienced."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Single player games because sometimes you just gotta play with yourself.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Keep the single player games coming. There are soooooo many games that would be ruined if made multiplayer.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I really hope that outer worlds finally gives me the feeling of when I played fallout 3 and New Vegas for the first time, I really want that nostalgia and a good game"

tLzp_xUr-gQ,Fingers crossed next-gen is more about single-player and couch coop games.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Sekiro was one of my favorite single player games ive played in a very long time. I couldn't get into the Dark Souls games but absolutely loved Sekiro. If you havent played it, its totally worth buying."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,playing full Witcher 3 for almost 3 weeks man I'm so happy I play this game its my first time
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I really enjoy how falcon looks hyped when he talks about single player games xD
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I find it kinda funny that he was talking about the ""top down"" aspect of Link's Awakening, while showing the only clip of the side view in the video. Wonder if that was intentional or not."

tLzp_xUr-gQ,Is it me or is nov 2019 will be  packed with so many amazing games
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Kids...
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"When you called Days Gone the 'mother of all zombie games' you put yourself on my ""never watch this channel"" list."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,10:16:00 AM
tLzp_xUr-gQ,E3: it actually plays right.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Am i suppose yo trust thst?
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Single player games are my favorite type of game.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,And to think next year is ELDEN RIIIIIIINNNNNNNGG!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I absolutely LOVED Bloodstained. One of the few games I 100%ed the shit out of and loved every second of it. Highly recommend.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Code Vein is a ""soulsborne"" style game coming out at the end of September that looks like it's worth the mention"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,There are other types of games besides single player?!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"That Tyrant (Mr. X) smile, will haunt me down on my dreams....NOOOOO"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Gameranx: makes these types of video
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Me: opens, immediately stop the video and look in the description"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I don't play online (never have) so thank you for this list!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"""I don know how you could like Dark Souls and Bloodborne and all of these types of games and not love this one"""
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Two reasons:
tLzp_xUr-gQ,1- Fixed protagonist;
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Watching this i had an odd realization i hardly ever play multiplayer games lol
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Name of the background track playing from the beginning onward please? Thanks <3
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Trails of Cold steel 3 also come out pretty soon in the states. It's a really good JRPG series
tLzp_xUr-gQ,It's nice when you open up YouTube and get this recommended straight up.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Best thing about Days Gone, the developers are still rolling out tons of great, free DLC for the game!"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Currently about 80% through Zelda: Links Awakening, after that i will finaly play Dragon Quest XI on the Switch."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Beside that i am looking forward to the Outer Worlds, just have to wait and see which version i am buying."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,He must’ve been sarcastic about everything he said about kingdom hearts 3. that game was so much worse than the second one
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Does Catherine: Full Body count I just love the puzzle platforming and I think the new stuff they added just make Catherine even better than it already was.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I just finished a plague tale and it was amazing I rented it friday and finished it sunday such a great game I wanted to finish it as soon as I started but once it ended made me want more plus Rodric man that part that part smh
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Outer wilds and outer worlds will be confusing haha
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Single-player games, what defines real gamers from casual gamers."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Legend of heroes, trails of cold steel 3 next month, an jrpg series"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"lol i was just about to comment ""man but i just bought control and i thought for sure it was atleast worth a mention"""
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"By the review you did on the game Falcon, I thought Control would have made the list. Why not ?"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,The Outer Worlds is probably going to take a year before all the major bugs are fixed. Open world rpgs are always riddled with bugs at launch.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"First off, fire emblem 3 houses was amazing. I enjoyed all 60 hours it took me to beat it. And as for outer world... I want it to be a good game.... But it looks so clunky.... I feel like I'm the only one seeing that. It's clunkier than fallout"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Single player has always been my favorite since I was a kid. Besides fighting Games.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,The surge 2 looks to improve on what made the surge great.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I feel like everyone has just forgotten how bad the surge was who actually asked for a sequel its just a clunky souls clone.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,How can you include games that aren't even released yet? They could be a buggy mess or just plain bad
tLzp_xUr-gQ,12:26:00 PM
tLzp_xUr-gQ,gaam games game gaam xD
tLzp_xUr-gQ,You uploaded a video of the early 2019 in September while RE 2 Remake Sekiro and Days Gone already in stores? Why for?
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Gears 5 is one of my favorites.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Dying light, waiting for dying light 2, definately destiny 2 awaiting shadowkeep drop. These are but a few of games I dont believe you mentioned."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I'm surprised you didn't mention that Sekiro is basically Tenchu + Dark Souls, I always called it Tenchusouls."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I'm convinced Shenmue 3 is going to be a disappointment.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"say ""honestly"" a couple more times and you win the reward of the honestlyiest man of the year"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Apex: Legends loot boxes are pretty much funding Star Wars Fallen Order,  Welcome to the new industry everybody?"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I have been puuting my hours into alternating between Greedfall, and watching both Star Trek: The Next Generation and Firefly for the first time ever."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I'm convinced Shenmue 3 is going to be a disappointment.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"say ""honestly"" a couple more times and you win the reward of the honestlyiest man of the year"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Making a ""top"" list doesn't mean listing every game that fits the genre and came out this year... XD"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Love how falcons voice matches the theme of the video. The overhyped games video his voice was low and groggy but this one he's talking about good games and he's full of energy and cheery lol XD love it. Great narrating
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I need to know what song as background misic is used in the first part.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,you guys are amazing! this is a bloody damn great list!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I was playing Dragon Quest Builders 2 non-stop. So that would have to be my favorate.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Days Gone came out months ago. Hardly ""new""."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Single-Player Games are the ONLY games that matter.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I’m still playing the Witcher 3, I just can’t put it down, pls help"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,And here I am still playing Fallout 4 ?
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Single player RPGs Wasteland 3 2020 and Encased easy access Sept 26.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"The outer wilds, the outer worlds."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Yo, what I've been realizing there is so much content of good games that as soon as I get frustrated with a game because of technical issues I just move on to the next game and never look back. Developers need to realize this and not release a game until it's finished."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Excited for Jedi: Fallen Order!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I feel like Falcon was far more enthusiastic in this video than normal because he wants to be VERY clear that single player games are still popular. Thank you for representing gamers.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I passed on Day's gone for some other game's I was waiting for but I'm definitely getting it now
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I really like your review, overall. But you must admit your take on why Kingdom Hearts should be in this least is rather poor."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I love it, Falcon with some of the best games for ps4. 2nd part plz."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Here I am still waiting for Microsoft flight sim, session, and beyond good and evil 2....."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Outer worlds is probably one of my most anticipated games of 2019 and Game pass means I get it day one for practically free
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Outer wilds is a game that I can definitely get behind.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I thought that borderlands 3 or rage 2 would be on the list, but I wasn’t disappointed by what was on the list: )"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I've been waiting to play Shenmue three for more than 15 years. Because they left the story unended.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Rage 2 should be on here. It's easily one of  best I've played this year.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Can you guys do a video for co-op games
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I highly recommend plague tale, days gone and res evil"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Kh3 was good but it gave me the realisation that I've grown up, dark souls changed me man"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Love this! I usually play more single player games more than online multiplayer
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Back in the day when you heard that a game had multiplayer in it, you thought cool that sounds like fun nowadays it means grindy gameplay, microtransactions, and unachievable trophies/ achievements because of asshole people. Companies and their greed has made multiplayer a dirty word in gaming"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I'm loving Gears 5
tLzp_xUr-gQ,A gamers Heartfelt thank you and in saving grief over what to find and play!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I'm so happy that FE3H was in the top 10
tLzp_xUr-gQ,I’ve got some serious catching up to do.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Outer Wilds is a goddamn masterpiece.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,When you put it like that looks like another damn good year for video games.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"RE2 remake, is a masterpiece and thank you Falcon for giving it the credit it deserves. I've spent well over 1000 hours in it, and still play it sporadically."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,FE:3H is my GOTY
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Lame! Lame!
tLzp_xUr-gQ,No Dying Light 2?! That's the only game I'm seriously looking forward to.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"The Surge took me a while to get into. Like Bloodborne, I installed it, played a few hours and then deleted it about 5 times before it got me. Something about it got under my skin and kept calling me back. Glad it did."
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"I thought he forgot he already mentioned ""Outer Worlds"" but then I checked the spelling again and ope! ""Outer Wild"" was the first one"
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Bloodstained is absolutely amazing. Best game of the year for me.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Outer wilds was amazing?
tLzp_xUr-gQ,Been playing Blasphemous lately. It's a perfect marriage of Castlevania and Dark Souls.
tLzp_xUr-gQ,"Hellooooo, Borderlands 3 !?!  my favorite single player game! "
vmDz1nuFSVE,"You can Support Me! by playing this android game from this link https://bit.ly/2Wk0FT4 and make donations by purchasing GEMS while Playing my Car Combine! if you like, have fun ?"
vmDz1nuFSVE,0:22 Final Fantasy VII Remake
vmDz1nuFSVE,1:48 Marvel’s Avengers
vmDz1nuFSVE,2:52 Werewolf The Apocalypse Earthblood
vmDz1nuFSVE,3:39 Cyberpunk 2077
vmDz1nuFSVE,Thumbnail looking like Vanzan from Reign of Fire...
vmDz1nuFSVE,"""That's what we need?WE'RE GOIN LONDON!"""
vmDz1nuFSVE,2:50 Werewolf game ! finally
vmDz1nuFSVE,I want Atari's Pitfall remake asap.
vmDz1nuFSVE,"That werewolf game looks really good, hopefully it’s open world"
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Not gonna lie, the majority of these games look absolutely gorgeous! I am sad though. I simply don’t have enough time to play all the great games coming out anymore. It is too hard (and expensive!) to keep up!"
vmDz1nuFSVE,Werewolf game!?¡ I hope ps4 or ps5 gets something like that. I'm so done with these mediocre medieval/supernatural like games.
vmDz1nuFSVE,"As for the last of us 2, I’m willing to wait for perfection.  I wish developers would do that more often.  I hate getting a new game and have it being bug filled for 6 months as I wait for patches."
vmDz1nuFSVE,"I thought the thumbnail was SEGA’s Altered Beast remake, that would have been cool to see."
vmDz1nuFSVE,2020 seems like an awesome year
vmDz1nuFSVE,Konami should remake metal gear solid 1 too the best metal gear solid
vmDz1nuFSVE,All this video editing just to sound like you recorded audio while sitting on your toilet?
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Dude, that apartment is nice as hell! And I'm a Steelers fan, I would love to live there, foreal!"
vmDz1nuFSVE,2:50 Werewolf game ! finally
vmDz1nuFSVE,2020 seems like an awesome year
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Dude, that apartment is nice as hell! And I'm a Steelers fan, I would love to live there, foreal!"
vmDz1nuFSVE,@7:55 Ghostrunner............gimme that in vr.
vmDz1nuFSVE,what we need is a sequel to God Hand. GET ON THIS SHINJI MY BOY
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the heavy metal"
vmDz1nuFSVE,Ori and the Will of the Wisps is what I'm looking forward to.
vmDz1nuFSVE,Every game here looks the same to me. First-Person-go-around-and-kill-stuff...fun for about five minutes.
vmDz1nuFSVE,what about elden ring
vmDz1nuFSVE,0/10. No gameboy games:(
vmDz1nuFSVE,there alot of delays now we gonna have a pretty large gaming drought in between these releases lol
vmDz1nuFSVE,Only looking forward to cyberpunk.
vmDz1nuFSVE,Deathloop looks like an episode of death love robots
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Skipped right pass Avengers.. Not interested, and sick of Avengers lol. FF7 remake, and Cyberpunk, will own 2020."
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Cyberpunk 2077, Doom Eternal, Ghost Of Tsushima will be my games :)"
vmDz1nuFSVE,all looks the same fashioned.
vmDz1nuFSVE,that werewolf game reminds me of alterbeast
vmDz1nuFSVE,Ugh! Remakes... Lazy programers is what I call it. Give us new stories damn it!?
vmDz1nuFSVE,This game is a work of art
vmDz1nuFSVE,I would put 2 more. Subnautica below zero and Elden ring. I literally can’t wait for those
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Seeing the thumbnail I thought that Devs are working on an altered beast remake, I really wish someone make a remake on altered beast that is one of the best game to be ever available during 20th century."
vmDz1nuFSVE,Is there also someone like me out here who doesn't have any console but still watches this because it's good ??
vmDz1nuFSVE,"While the western AAA titles look graphically and technically phenomenal, I wish there were more non-lethal game play options."
vmDz1nuFSVE,"Dying light 2, the last of us 2 and cyberpunk are the only games I have any hopes for. Everything that's come out has been boring garbage. I think the Witcher 3 spoiled me cause nothing has come close to being as good as that game"
vmDz1nuFSVE,Lost soul aside take my money JUST TAKE IT
vmDz1nuFSVE,Why does everyone forget bannerlord
vmDz1nuFSVE,Marvel's Avengers is Dead coming out on my birthday.
vmDz1nuFSVE,Are you forgetting System Shock Remake?
vmDz1nuFSVE,Lost soul aside looks damm good
IVsMSPNVHR0,I just hope Cyberpunk never ends up in a list like this
IVsMSPNVHR0,Fallout 76 should be higher on the list now after recent developments to charge a monthly fee for a broken game
IVsMSPNVHR0,Only one of these I liked was watchdogs
IVsMSPNVHR0,He was brooding because HIS NIECE DIED AND IT WAS HIS FAULT
IVsMSPNVHR0,"“Bethesda has never disappointed me so I’m gonna preorder fallout 76” -me, 2018"
IVsMSPNVHR0,It’s depressing how many of these games I owned.
IVsMSPNVHR0,I’d like to point out that a huge amount of these are games made by EA
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Evolve was actually a great game, people just didnt want to take the time to learn it. It wasn't a point and shoot game it was cooperate with your team, and fuck up the hunters as a boss monster."
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Dude you for the most over hyped, ruined games of this generation METAL GEAR SOLID 5"
IVsMSPNVHR0,2:55 Windows XP wallpaper.
IVsMSPNVHR0,"lol when the video started i was thinking of AC: Unity off the bat, and yep, was the first one mentioned lmao. I also remember all the fuss around Fallout 76 on twitch some people liked it (those who didn't want to say they hated it), but most simply hated it."
IVsMSPNVHR0,Props to No man's sky developers for not giving up
IVsMSPNVHR0,And fixing the game
IVsMSPNVHR0,I remember the game homefront was really hyped up. Ended up beating it in like a hour. I was so pissed.
IVsMSPNVHR0,Battlefront 2 is dope as hell! Its three years in and there still dropping maps and new content.
IVsMSPNVHR0,I didn't expect Mass effect to be on number one on this list.
IVsMSPNVHR0,Ark survival evolved was broken af at launch
IVsMSPNVHR0,The game: Ohh you wonna play me? SICK! You need a freaking NVIDIA Titan for that buddy!
IVsMSPNVHR0,me: ..... (crying)
IVsMSPNVHR0,Moral of the story: Never preorder people.
IVsMSPNVHR0,I really felt that Anthem one. I was so hyped for that game just to get a game that is so boring I thinking mining in Minecraft is more interesting than that game.
IVsMSPNVHR0,"I loved Evolve, Anthem, Battlefront 2"
IVsMSPNVHR0,5:16 you're welcome....
IVsMSPNVHR0,Why do nearly all of these disasters have EA in common
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Damn, I liked Watch Dogs."
IVsMSPNVHR0,"""Anthem is a destiny killer"""
IVsMSPNVHR0,Everyone when anthem was revealed
IVsMSPNVHR0,"I know I'm going to get flak for this, but... I really enjoyed Andromeda. My biggest letdown was that we didn't get any Quarians. I was so happy to think we'd get Quarians in the sequel"
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Fallout 76 was the saddest experience I’ve had in gaming, I bought the deluxe edition and played it for an hour then never played it again..."
IVsMSPNVHR0,"""...and now we're getting into the dark meat."""
IVsMSPNVHR0,woah hold up there bruh
IVsMSPNVHR0,Evolved. Was one of the best experiences I've ever played..... for about 40 hours. It needed to continue to evolve but didn't. If you can play it in a lan party do it.
IVsMSPNVHR0,Why do nearly all of these disasters have EA in common
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Haze was my childhood so obviously I'm gonna be bias, but I actually really enjoyed that game and its story and I hate that it flopped, it definatly had potential. Still to this day one of my favourite story games actually. Ig its unfortunate that people dont like it for whatever reasons ????"
IVsMSPNVHR0,@2:53 and I would add : '' and running on the famous windows desktop field ....''
IVsMSPNVHR0,Me andromeda was dope as shit that was exactly the right step mass effect needed.
IVsMSPNVHR0,'IMO' Evolve was a good game BUT it got old really quick since there wasn't that much content to play around with on the long run. But I had fun with it as long as it lasted! :)
IVsMSPNVHR0,When anthem is the first thing that comes to your mind before even watching lol
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Maaaaan i forgot haze existed, thank you for reminding me"
IVsMSPNVHR0,"14:13 Yes I actually have, have you heard of lawbreakers before? There is your example"
IVsMSPNVHR0,2:55 Windows XP wallpaper.
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Damn, I liked Watch Dogs."
IVsMSPNVHR0,"""Anthem is a destiny killer"""
IVsMSPNVHR0,Everyone when anthem was revealed
IVsMSPNVHR0,Overhyped crap? Crackdown 3 surely! Microsoft had to disable the reviews after about 3 days is was so pitiful.
IVsMSPNVHR0,Really enjoyed evolve thought it was pretty fun. The only gripe I had was having to pay for characters and monsters
IVsMSPNVHR0,"I loved watchdogs, it was fun and amazing. Then watchdogs 2 came out and I realized just how bad 1 was."
IVsMSPNVHR0,Battlefront 2 is great now. its absolutely amazing!
IVsMSPNVHR0,Ark
IVsMSPNVHR0,Was actually pretty awesome when first came out
IVsMSPNVHR0,But kept adding and adding
IVsMSPNVHR0,"Remember when that guy from Polygon told everyone ""if you think Sim City can be updated to be made offline you literally don't know what you're talking about"" then a few days later a fan patch made it able to be played offline?  Pepperidge Farms remembers. "
zBaDMJknffU,My wallet “here we go again”

zBaDMJknffU,Next year will be a competition
zBaDMJknffU,FF7 Remake is what matters to me the most
zBaDMJknffU,"Great year! Doom Eternal, RE3, Cyberpunk, , Last of Us 2, Halo Infinite... Plus Nintendo has to have some titles hidden ready to be shown.. or else it's kinda embarrassing."
zBaDMJknffU,"Doom Eternal, Halo Infinite, MS Flight Simulator, Ghost of Tsushima, and Last of Us 2"
zBaDMJknffU,Edit: And Ori and the Will of the Wisps
zBaDMJknffU,Missed Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition

cUgrN9ZEffc,Always great to see some VIC-20 love.  
cUgrN9ZEffc,There are some seriously cool VIC homebrew games out there.  Pixel's Pulse is a lovely side scrolling shooter.  He's also got a version of Arkanoid in the works which is beyond impressive.  There's also a version of Doom out there and there are great games like Misfit's Pentagorat and Cheese and Onion.
cUgrN9ZEffc,"Gotta love gaming on the classic Vic-20. Thanks for the gameplay my friend, good stuff indeed!"
cUgrN9ZEffc,"Nice to see people, still having love for the classic micro computers."
cUgrN9ZEffc,Thank's for the amazing video :o)
cUgrN9ZEffc,I still have my vic20 from 1981 and I always have kept it in that huge polystyrene case that came with it. Still in mint condition 37 years later.
cUgrN9ZEffc,Not all games work because they are made for certain RAM expansion configurations.
cUgrN9ZEffc,'Manic' not 'Maniac'  sorry ;)
cUgrN9ZEffc,aaah my goodness - I love your videos :) keep on going!
cUgrN9ZEffc,Yay Vic-20 homebrews ??
cUgrN9ZEffc,8:09 wrong memory config
cUgrN9ZEffc,"Watcha Dude, Some of the games may have to run on the expanded vic."
cUgrN9ZEffc,VIC-20 seems really popular lately.
cUgrN9ZEffc,"Wow these games are hideous, there are some decent VIC homebrews out there... these aren't them. "
9DkBYixYBFs,Me:  See's fallout 76 at number 20
9DkBYixYBFs,Also Me: This is going to be a rough list bois
9DkBYixYBFs,"Number one: raid shadow legends, oh wait that’s an ad Nevermind"
9DkBYixYBFs,"The mobile game on this list, ""Dungeon Keeper"", sounds like ALL mobile games to me. All of the mobile games try to entice players to spend money. They are all rigged in this regard."
9DkBYixYBFs,Watchmojo: this game has terrible voice acting 
9DkBYixYBFs,Also watchmojo: 14:45
9DkBYixYBFs,I’m sorry. I started dying of laughter when they started singing “I’m Han Solo.” That caught me off guard.
9DkBYixYBFs,They made Rambo look like Adam Sandler
9DkBYixYBFs,The next decade of bad games will be even worse than this.
9DkBYixYBFs,Never heard most of them. Probably a good thing
9DkBYixYBFs,"""so before we get to the absolute worst game of the year.."" huh?"
9DkBYixYBFs,Wwe is too low on this list :( doesn’t even work in 2020
9DkBYixYBFs,“The AI switches between really smart and then really stupid.” 
9DkBYixYBFs,Me: so they finally accurately portrayed a real person????
9DkBYixYBFs,"“So before we get to the worst game of the year...” yeah, you guys are one to throw shade on a game for quality control when you can’t even be bothered to fix your script."
9DkBYixYBFs,"Damn, not even an honorable mention of Day One: Garry's Incident? :O"
9DkBYixYBFs,“Godzilla is approaching the generator! The generator is losing power!”
9DkBYixYBFs,“He’s a man! Not a god!”
9DkBYixYBFs,To be fair battlefront II is an amazing multiplayer game now.
9DkBYixYBFs,Ride to Hell: Retribution is a legendary game for all the wrong reasons.
9DkBYixYBFs,I knew Ride to Hell: Retribution would top the list.
9DkBYixYBFs,GODZILLA IS APPROACHING THE GENERATOR
9DkBYixYBFs,GENERATOR IS LOSING POWER
9DkBYixYBFs,ANGRY JOE P.D.S.T
9DkBYixYBFs,"It's so nice, that everyone forgot Metal gear Survive, like it's never happend."
9DkBYixYBFs,"No ""Depression Quest""?"
9DkBYixYBFs,"Well, I guess not everyone has the gut to tackle it."
9DkBYixYBFs,Kinect Star Wars: *exist*
9DkBYixYBFs,Me: OHHHH MYYYY GGOOOOOOOODDDDD!!!
9DkBYixYBFs,"13:00 “I think my controller is broken, I’m going to the Strip club”"
9DkBYixYBFs,LMAO Black Tiger sounded like someone whistling instead of wind ????
9DkBYixYBFs,"I think everyone agrees with Number ONE ....it is the biggest"" Number Two"" ever produced for Video Gaming !!!"
9DkBYixYBFs,Luckily for me i didn’t buy any of these.
9DkBYixYBFs,Why isn't Overkill's The Walking Dead on here
9DkBYixYBFs,I'm shocked metal gear survive is not even as horonable mention.
9DkBYixYBFs,And CrackDown 3 was Lame and beyond Half-Assed.
9DkBYixYBFs,Me sees ride to hell at number 1: ah yes the masterpiece
9DkBYixYBFs,Kinect Star Wars?  That's the most hilarious concept of a game I've seen
9DkBYixYBFs,Life of black tiger AVGN 2019.
9DkBYixYBFs,"“He’s a man, Not a God!’"
9DkBYixYBFs,Imagine taking super seducer seriously and not as a massive meme.
9DkBYixYBFs,"Idc what anyone says, the “I’m solo” song was a bop and so was the rest of the game"
9DkBYixYBFs,17:04 me turning on the pc at 2:00 am
9DkBYixYBFs,"kinect star wars is the beast game ever made, you just don't see its beauty"
9DkBYixYBFs,If Ride to Hell: Retribution isn't number one...
9DkBYixYBFs,Edit: All is good in the world.
9DkBYixYBFs,"""For all of those who enjoyed the sport of rugby, (not me!)"" Lmfao"
9DkBYixYBFs,Can't tell if your accent is Australian or American
9DkBYixYBFs,Rambo felt like an arcade game to be completely honest.
9DkBYixYBFs,DON’T YOU DARE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT GODZILLA!
9DkBYixYBFs,"Never heard of Umbrella Corp, yet that sounds like a great idea for a game!"
9DkBYixYBFs,Yes. Because when I think of watchmojo I think “gamers”.
9DkBYixYBFs,Pretty much every game on this list angry joe did a review
9DkBYixYBFs,"“Great courage can keep the virtue from evil”, dude lol!"
9DkBYixYBFs,"How was anthem left out completly, not even a mention"
9DkBYixYBFs,Here's a new game title: Left Alone in the Dark with the Last of Us...
9DkBYixYBFs,Notice how most of these game have awful names to begin with. “Vroom in the night sky..” no way in hell that even had potential.
9DkBYixYBFs,03:19 That glitch reminds me of that segment in AVGN during his Game Glitches episode where Clubber Lang looked so unbelievably horrifying.
9DkBYixYBFs,Fallout 76 at only 20? Good lord we've had a lot of bad games this decade.
9DkBYixYBFs,"The hype for Anthem was crazy, how is that not number one?"
9DkBYixYBFs,They had to have used the superman 64 engine on 'vroom'... right?
9DkBYixYBFs,"That couldn't have happened by chance, I won't believe it????"
9DkBYixYBFs,"Honestly, Steel Battalion would probably be great in VR."
9DkBYixYBFs,I don't even know most of these games
9DkBYixYBFs,Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is my #1 worst game. It’s just personal. ?
9DkBYixYBFs,Fallout '76: underlying cause of my favorite in-store freak out vid ?
9DkBYixYBFs,05:04:00 PM
9DkBYixYBFs,Goddammit! My ears are bleeding!
9DkBYixYBFs,I was waiting intensively for him to say anthem
9DkBYixYBFs,2020 and still waiting for the Remaster edition of Amy.
9DkBYixYBFs,Good list but if you actually played fallout 76 now you would realise that it's not as bad as people think. It absolutely didn't desrve to be on the list
9DkBYixYBFs,12:56:00 PM
9DkBYixYBFs,One name: Kevin
9DkBYixYBFs,17:15 kinetic Star Wars was only an honorable mention because of that amazing song
9DkBYixYBFs,"dude super seducer is one of the funniest games ive ever played, well, its more an interactive movie but it doesnt take itself seriously, shock value"
9DkBYixYBFs,Me: sets up YouTube gaming channel aged 38.
9DkBYixYBFs,Rest of world: calls me nonce & my YouTube channel fails miserably.
9DkBYixYBFs,"Star Wars Kinect is the single greatest thing ever, you take it back"
9DkBYixYBFs,"""A quiet man"" should be at this list"
9DkBYixYBFs,2:43 literally just stole the rust rad noise Ik that’s it’s the actual noise of a Geiger counter but still
9DkBYixYBFs,"16:50 ""worst game of the year"""
9DkBYixYBFs,How are the Tony Hawk games even still a thing? I haven't seen a skating game in person since I was a kid in the 90's.
9DkBYixYBFs,I like how the watch mojo and IGN people are actually using emotion in their voices now
9DkBYixYBFs,"This list just tells me that I have good taste in video games, because I have played none of these."
9DkBYixYBFs,I legit bought the tony hawk game a few years ago and wondered why it never started up??
9DkBYixYBFs,I tried to convince my self that the voice isn’t modest pelican the whole video
9DkBYixYBFs,Ride to Hell: Retribution
9DkBYixYBFs,"i feel like anthem should be there, i saw it at the shop the other day brand new for only $4 i almost pissed myself laughing, they wouldnt be able to give it away if it was free"
9DkBYixYBFs,3:20 Wow - Im in love with a Coco :)
9DkBYixYBFs,Finally after years a waiting for a front mission and they screw it up.
9DkBYixYBFs,"Dang, that guy is totally pissed about Umbrella Corps!"
9DkBYixYBFs,You forgot Jericho that's one of the most disappointing games ever made!
9DkBYixYBFs,Do you remember when you could choose to go online or just play solo 
pdD2vMgAdh4,Halo 3 doesn’t even make the list but Pokémon GO does...I’m calling the cops
pdD2vMgAdh4,Ok so this is the worst list created in human history
pdD2vMgAdh4,Should be titled “100 random games in ten minutes”
pdD2vMgAdh4,"When Fortnite is on the list, but Celeste isn’t."
pdD2vMgAdh4,"IGN: * puts Fortnite above Mega Man 3, Undertale, and Persona *"
pdD2vMgAdh4,This list looks like randomly generated.
pdD2vMgAdh4,The fact that Skyrim is 73 completely shows this list is a a joke
pdD2vMgAdh4,Half of the comments:
pdD2vMgAdh4,"""Sees Pokemon go"""
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Not a single SEGA game, not even Sonic. GTFOH"
pdD2vMgAdh4,M-Mario odyessy  isn’t up there?!Wha-
pdD2vMgAdh4,Let's not forget that this is a list from IGN.
pdD2vMgAdh4,"I promised myself I wasn’t gonna be upset as this is just someone’s opinion, and then they put Fortnite above persona 5."
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Ah yes, miss. pac man is WAY better than mario oduyssey"
pdD2vMgAdh4,#100: Pokemon Go!
pdD2vMgAdh4,Me: And I thought my jokes were bad...
pdD2vMgAdh4,IGN: Nostalgia>Gameplay
pdD2vMgAdh4,So I’m going to assume that this list is in no specific order
pdD2vMgAdh4,We forgot the most important one...
pdD2vMgAdh4,Wizard 101
pdD2vMgAdh4,"When you see Final Fantasy VII in No. 96, you know this is a joke of a list."
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Just remember guys, ign rated fortnite higher then persona 5"
pdD2vMgAdh4,"No Conker’s Bad Fur Day, no Age of Empires II, no Pikmin? The Legend of Zelda OOT number 25?"
pdD2vMgAdh4,Ign: 100 pokemon go 
pdD2vMgAdh4,Me: turns off video
pdD2vMgAdh4,"1:33 If you hear and see Contra, we're friends."
pdD2vMgAdh4,I knew that when Fortnite made the list and red dead 2 was in the 60’s I was gonna hate this list
pdD2vMgAdh4,I really wish this was posted on April Fools...
pdD2vMgAdh4,I feel like that Botw deserved to be in it's place but ocarina of time 25?I don't think so
pdD2vMgAdh4,Even WatchMojo's accuracy is better than this
pdD2vMgAdh4,Wow this list was even worse than my already incredibly low expectations.
pdD2vMgAdh4,"thief, system shock, half life. great list. ""we take stock of the games that have stood the test of time""   true."
pdD2vMgAdh4,Idk if I missed it but I didn’t see Mortal Kombat.. smh
pdD2vMgAdh4,“We are the lazy generation” sparked so many childhood memories
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Ahem...Kingdom hearts, Sekiro, Sly Cooper, Super Mario Odessy"
pdD2vMgAdh4,Why IGN? just why...
pdD2vMgAdh4,Youtuber: I am gonna make a list of best games ever.
pdD2vMgAdh4,Same youtuber after 10 drinks:
pdD2vMgAdh4,I'd want whatever IGN is smoking whilst making this list.
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Was so glad to see super Metroid represented well, but ocarina of time being as low as it was and banjo kazooie not even on this list is a farce!!"
pdD2vMgAdh4,*sees Pokemon Go on a top-100 games of all-time list 
pdD2vMgAdh4,"Aight, I'ma head out."
pdD2vMgAdh4,I lost interest when I saw red dead redemption 2 in 62nd place lol
pdD2vMgAdh4,0/10 No Assassin's Creed 2 or Brotherhood ??
pdD2vMgAdh4,jk
pdD2vMgAdh4,"WHAT how dare you put the breath of the wild 4th it should be 1st, Blasphemous."
pdD2vMgAdh4,This was actually 10 minutes and 3 seconds lies
pdD2vMgAdh4,"I mean, to be fair, 10 minutes is probably also how long they actually spent writing this list."

yq3F7BKl0Fg,"Holy moley you guys, this year was incredibly tough to bring down to just 10, there were so many games I wanted to add on here but couldn't cause the list was too full; Outer Wilds, Cadence of Hyrule, Borderlands 3, Metro Exodus, Anthem, Bloodstained ... Nah I'm just kidding about that 2nd last one. But still, let me know what your top 10 Games of the Year are."
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Plot twist : The Goose stole the best game of the year trophy
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Wow. Metro Exodus is not even an honorable mention. 
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Disappointing. That game was great.
yq3F7BKl0Fg,“For these reasons Resident Evil 2 will be eligible for this list.”
yq3F7BKl0Fg,"Me: So in short, it’s on the list and don’t question it. Got it."
yq3F7BKl0Fg,The thumbnail be like:
yq3F7BKl0Fg,"""Dante!!!"""

yq3F7BKl0Fg,5: DMC 5
yq3F7BKl0Fg,3: Luigi's Mansion 3
yq3F7BKl0Fg,2: Resident evil 2 
yq3F7BKl0Fg,More than a coincidence?
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Devil May Cry 5 is my favorite game of 2019. Hell it's replaced Devil May Cry 3 as my favorite game
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Death Stranding is my GOTY
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Astral Chain is missing the list. This is the best action-rpg ever.
yq3F7BKl0Fg,If A Plague Tale Innocence isn’t on here then I’m gonna be really upset. I don’t care what any critic tells me. That game was a masterpiece.
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Why!?!
yq3F7BKl0Fg,"Goat Simulator: Finally, a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary."
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Untitled Goose Game: I missed the part where that's my problem.
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Fire Emblem getting the recognition it deserves ugh it feels good...
yq3F7BKl0Fg,What happened to Borderlands 3 and Metro Exodus
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Fire emblem looks sweet. I need to play these games!
yq3F7BKl0Fg,"if nobody in the office liked Death's Stranding, then why is it on the Honorable Mentions list? ?"

yq3F7BKl0Fg,You just predicted Game of the Year 2019
yq3F7BKl0Fg,I agree pretty much with every choice you made here. My top 3 of this year is:
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Sekiro
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Fire Emblem: Three Houses
yq3F7BKl0Fg,Here’s my Top 10!:
yq3F7BKl0Fg,1. A Plague Tale: Innocence
yq3F7BKl0Fg,2. Death Stranding
yq3F7BKl0Fg,"Weirdly, I feel like this goose game seems almost like Hitman."
yq3F7BKl0Fg,I was shocked when death stranding game came and he said “no one like it in the office” .
yq3F7BKl0Fg,I'm genuinely surprised Astral Chain didn't get an honorable mention.
yq3F7BKl0Fg,I feel like no one played Metro Exodus

mWQ_x2ltWD8,"Why is every Player in FIFA so thin? And the movement from the Players is so unreal. The only positive things are, Gras (Pitch) looks good. Stadium Atmosphere (Crowd Reaction) couldn't be better. Gameplay from pes is so much better."
mWQ_x2ltWD8,I'm pro in soccer
mWQ_x2ltWD8,??
mWQ_x2ltWD8,"FIFA 19 dlc , u better call it ????????"
mWQ_x2ltWD8,FIFA será sempre o melhor.

mWQ_x2ltWD8,en los últimos fifas se mueven muy lento los jugadores
mWQ_x2ltWD8,Post Taken Out by EA:
mWQ_x2ltWD8,And the Fraud continues
mWQ_x2ltWD8,"This game is really a fraud. It's impossible for someone outside central Europe to play a decent online game, given the widely known servers, lag and so forth issues. But if that isn't enough, there's the manipulative and fraudulent gameplay, that let us see marvelous things, like a 72 pace player beat 91 Hazard in sprint, only online. This is a game that involves players spending money (that's why EA was forced to display the packs probabilities), prizes, and player money. It shouldn't be like that. This way, EA can fraudulently control and manipulate who wins and who loses. If this was just a funny game, ok, but that's not the case. This type of game manipulation should be banned, it's basically a fraud."
mWQ_x2ltWD8,Pes20 win
mWQ_x2ltWD8,"Do the fans boo and shout nasty remarks as in real life?...Not very realistic is it, and does the ref see one foul but misses another...Stupid ? Sport..??? "

KSA9Ltcp3R8,It would be better if these features are added
KSA9Ltcp3R8,1. Drop catches and let the user decide in which side he should throw the ball for the run out chance.
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"2. Most times, even AI's low skilled batsman who may be a bowler hits sixes and fours back to back unlike a formal batsman. This should be avoided. Once or twice is fine like through the slip."
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"Really Disappointed, it should have been improve graphics and add actual my career mode and add more realistic batting style and Fielding"
KSA9Ltcp3R8,We need career mode
KSA9Ltcp3R8,please add injuries sledging friendship moments retiring and giving him a respect emotional moments match drawn and super over
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Should be more on the update like fielding improvements stumping improvement running catches... And graphics should also be improved.. Nt gd update
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"me and my many friends don't play multilayer mood so nothing new for me... improve graphics, faces and bowling style"
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Atleast Make the wicket taking option somewhat sensible this time...2019 update was a crap even in very easy mode it was almost impossible to pick wickets
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Really disappointed you must have worked on other things stressing only on multiplayer is not a good strategy  
KSA9Ltcp3R8,             If you support me like plzzz
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"Instead of more multiplayer features, should've focused on improving the fielding (e.g. having dropped catches, stumping opportunities) and updating team squads regularly..."
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"Need more improvements like Updated Auction List of IPL, Graphics, Fielding, Snicko & DRS, more stats in the Premier League/Auction."
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Note*
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Every important feature need to be bought
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Need more improvement like fielding diving catches overthrow
KSA9Ltcp3R8,When the update will come
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Since 2 years almost there is no. Catch drop option in the fielding of this game
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"One thing that is really important, the thing that should be improved that when we run after hitting a ball we should see the ball going to a fielder or gap. IT IS very dangerous to take a run without seeing the ball where it goes. When wee hit the ball immidiately we should notice the direction of the ball"
KSA9Ltcp3R8,I wait for T20 world cup 2020 and player and jersey customize.Please add this features in RC 20
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Waiting for the big update. 
KSA9Ltcp3R8,When is it releasing? because Feb has already started.
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Please launch it as fast as you can.
KSA9Ltcp3R8,add strength meter stamina meter in all formats .In real cricket no hits a six on every ball but in this game it's possible so do something about it. Improve fielding . add career mode. Add trading of players in auction
KSA9Ltcp3R8,I want to see ball goes to second and third slip in test with new ball when batsmen try to drive through cover and extra cover
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"This game is the next level of ANDROID cricket gaming ,JustbAmazing"
KSA9Ltcp3R8,When will rc 20 release
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Stop adding modes and start improving mechanics
KSA9Ltcp3R8,WHEN WAS RC20 COME
KSA9Ltcp3R8,It's hard to play in multiplayer when MF bowl on leg side short bowls
KSA9Ltcp3R8,You guys are improving tremendously every year. ??
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Thanks for taking my review on Malinga action
KSA9Ltcp3R8,"Nice Trailer,I Hope 2019 World Cup will be Unlocked without MoneyAnd Also World Test championship Feature which is shown in Trailer Should be Free (By Unlocking with Tickets) rather than Money ,If It will be paid then the Feature is Useless"
KSA9Ltcp3R8,add diving option in fielding its good to see some spectacular fielding efforts at boundary line
KSA9Ltcp3R8,They should add new tournaments like next England will have new franchisee cricket league called the HUNDRED ?
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Don't let expectations fall off !! 
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Bring something new and unique in the gameplay
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Yes. We want new stadiums every month.add 20 overs in multiplayer.add 2019 world cup for  us to play.Thanks.keep on working dude.well done

KSA9Ltcp3R8,When it'll be released
KSA9Ltcp3R8,Most important.... Fielding improve and comentry improve

KSA9Ltcp3R8,When it is going to be released
KSA9Ltcp3R8,When you are releasing

GamerGate wasn't just made up of trolls and misogynists, it had actual good intentions behind it, but of course, you've gotta go and stand with Anita Sarkeesian and Zoey Quinn because God f*cking forbid you try to actually be unbiased when talking about a situation. Need I remind you that one of those ladies falsely accused a man of sexual assault, which then lead to said man committing suicide! Are you seriously going to just push that aside, because I would personally see the suicide of a beloved game creator as a bigger gaming controversy than GamerGate."

(imo gaming addiction is real, it can make people's lives as unmanageable as alcohol drugs food sex and gambling, and i sympathize with ppl's tendencies to defend it as i was pretty defensive about my own addictive behaviors, but if recovery is possible for an alcoholic with dt's then it's certainly possible for a gaming addict)"
,I still can't believe how gamergate went from ethics in videogame journalism to.. sexism and misogyny. It's two completely different and unrelated topics.

,"You say ""gaming controversies"" but most of these are just random complaints no one has heard about. Some of these are valid, but most are obvious fillers to make a top ten video. I somewhat wish watch mojo would just stay away from video games lol."
,"Konami really did RUIN themselves after what they did to Hideo Kojima. Remember when Konami was a""respected"" name in gaming industry? And everything was good but nooo stop developing all franchises, fire Hideo Kojima and his team and look where they are now. Now after fucking up their last good franchise Metal Gear Solid. They now have money issues and struggling in the game industry with PES. Totally deserved. I hope every game company learn a good lesson from Konami. Greed is always ruining and if microtransactions continue. Game industry would END"
,Gotta love how bias and one sided Watchmojo is with these controversies.
,You spent like...what a minute on gamergate?
,Obviously sexism racism islamophobia and transphobia are the key issues with gaming.
,"Obviously. I mean, what else could it be? We need to fix gaming asap, like we fixed starwars and Ghostbusters."
,"The main thing that needs to change is the players. Most of the other problems are caused by us both directly and indirectly. In that same vein, devs need to stop constantly kowtowing to player demands. A tiny subset of gamers complaining/demanding things are just loud and act out enough to get the devs to notice. It's like throwing a tantrum, and devs need to stop placating them, because it alienates more gamers than are being pleased."
,Dexit is the most Controversy for me.
,I wonder why pay to play online hasn't become a controversy and the fact that game downloads are becoming to beg. I really wish that gaming would be a lot more fair to gamers who don't have a lot of money.

,"#3 on this list is total BS. We know video games aren't to blame for gun violence in America because gun violence has been a problem since before video games were ever invented. I'd say the main problem stems from the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution and people's continued use and abuse of it. We know that it's outdated and a product of a time when this country was still in the early stages of its development while we were fighting for our freedom to be an independent nation. Back then guns and firearms were just muskets, rifles, and pistols capable of firing one shot at a time and took time to reload.  If the founding fathers knew how far weapons and guns would evolve over time, I'm sure they would've reconsidered the Constitution giving US citizens the personal right to have them."
,That was actually a reasonably fair coverage of Gamergate.
,THE WII U SHOULD BE #1
,"here's an unpopular opinion. I believe that the statement that video games cause violence holds a decent amount of weight. people who are depressed and people who have mental disorders are easier to influence. does this mean everybody can play GTA and go out and shoot people, no? we have to keep in mind though that a few of the school shootings were committed by people with mental disorders. and I believe there is some kind of correlation."
,Stay out of the limelight of games Trump. 
,"Your not welcomed here if your blaming video games on real life violence, because it’s easy to use as a scapegoat"
,"How is Microtransations not #1 on this list? It's by and far not only the most continuously controversial issue in gaming but it's by far the worst thing to happen to gaming. Unlike most of these other things, they happened and have relatively gone away (or will) and will be forgotten. Microtransactions just keep getting worse, more manipulative, and actually impact gameplay in a negative way and isn't going away. Even GamerGate isn't as bad, IMO."
,I really wish Konami would regret what they did to Kojima. Don’t treat your employees like trash companies! Yes I’m aware they’ve done screwups in recent years but they did put out a few decent titles this decade and for sure next decade I’m really excited for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 Mini! A lot of Konami fans wish for the company to have its former glory back including myself. I hope BioWare does the same. Will they fix Anthem? Let’s find out in the coming years. Microtransactions are mostly found in AAA games with online features and most online games today in general and they are optional and I understand a lot of you hate that feature. Let us hope those controversies teach people future lessons.
,"EA basicly cancelled a Ooen World Star Wars game for no reason, not brcause it would take too long, but for No Reason At All!

The part when you said women are not getting enough in the gaming community is getting out of had and is really messed up and xbox needs to do something it makes XBL look bad. More kids play games than adults even if adults spend more money. i would say kids cat fishing has became a huge problem and the real women that want money to you to play with them need to end in the clubs in the dashboard.
,"I remembered thinking Donald Trump sounded like a lazy parent when he blamed video games for a shooting...I still think that he’s an idiot for thinking this. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to gather more minerals to build a rocket in Subnautica"
,"I don't support GamerGate, but I totally support the reasons GamerGate was kickstarted."
,"There is not much difference between conservatives and christians trying to ban, censor and change videogames because violence and satanism, and liberals and feminists trying to ban, censor and change videogames because sexism and offensive content, it also applies to other media, the Joker movie proved that moral panic changed the political ideology but it's overall the same, the difference is that back then, gamers were free to bash the old political correctness as much as they wanted, fighting against Fox News was an honor, now, the new political correctness is untouchable and gamers are a bunch of virgins and manchildren for fighting against Kotaku."
,"I understand the backlash towards Anita Sarkeesian has encouraged her to disable comments on her videos, but I feel like she would be better off turned on. This makes her come across as arrogant because you can’t open up conversation with her team. She makes good points for sure, but there are others where she misses the mark."
,"Yeah cos trump says video games cause violence then orange man bad, but sarkesian says video games cause sexism and gets paid millions, which is it"
,No man sky is actually good now believe it or not the same thing with star wars battlefront 2
,Of the last decade
,am I the only one who read that wrong
,Next: Top 20 Donald Trump Controversies of the Decade! ?
,How dare you bag on inquisition have you no honor
,Kinda cringe how some people race to type first on a video
,"video games are for losers change my mind anyone, i dare you to."
,the Xbox One is better than PS4 tho.....
,Some of these entries happened during this decade. Not last decade.
,"It's not ""Gun Violence"" to begin with, it's just people violence."
,First
,Overworked and harsh work environment........... isn't that just the real world?
,I would have thought the whole National Dex not being in Pokémon Sword and Shield thing would be on the list or at least a honorable mention.
,"Parents be like all we deal with is all fun and games but not nothing the history and he drama we deal with every day microtransactions should be push hard till it exist more. It only exist cause game developers these days create  a cheap peice of art and knowing it will suck they out it in to make up for the laziness. Triple A titles ha! We need to stop using these terms to describe games these days. How about triple F games. Funny how a small independent team can create a masterpiece then a whole building of greedy turds. I don't  blame animators  and the people who actually create the games but all these corporate heads who just want a quick buck that they take what being a creative artist is into a cow milking ranch. This laziness has to stop just think about how many people their are that have a great idea for a story or just gameplay but they can't do it cause ""it doesn't make enough money""  somebody please issue order 66 on these corporate heads........""onces more the sith will rule the galaxy...and we shall have peace""- lord Sidious."
,"So Mr Trump blames video games for the violence in this country? I don't think a video game can make you buy a gun and start killing people, that's something you have to decide doing, after watching GTA V I do think that in recent years we'd seen an increase in the bad guy glorification in video games and some movies, but still, a video game (just as alcohol) won't put anything in your head that is not already there."
,"Of course it had to be Gamergate. Zoe Quinn's allegations had caused the pushback against feminism and the MGTOW and fragile masculinity project where men's right activists chant, ""IhategirlsIhategirlsIhategirlsIhategirls"" with the controversy still being felt today with pushback again women in any media."
,The gaming disorder thing was so stupid. Too many nerds got defensive because the CDC said that some people get addicted to gaming. Which is true.
,Trump for President 2020
,Kinda saw no. 1 coming. Didn't realize anything like that happened years ago. But the hate online is real and damaging for your psyche. Gamers don't pay attention that much to a character. The most is sympathize or do something gross. This is fiction. It's as dangerous as other works of fiction are.
,Sexism is a problem in every industry... problem being you can’t put women in their place like you could back in the good old days.
,"“I’m going to get pregnant and need you to accommodate me, oh also I can’t kill spiders, and plan on me tooing you if I have a bad day... but I swear I’m equal!”"
,"Equal pay? Nobody is equal to begin with. Some people have degrees and others don't, so therefore they can't be paid the same."
,"Video games aren’t to blame for violence, that’s not to say we should take guns away. Arm the teachers, and push for more concealed carry."
,What about Junichi Masuda thanosing half of the Pokédex?
,Just a reminder theres a disorder for gaming but not for being trans!
,Gamers love to hate on women until they can buy their bath water.
,"Other controversies could've been featured here, such as:"
,- Ubisoft's downgrades
,- Diablo Eternal announcement
,"- Battlefield V, where a bunch of dudes complained about lack of historical accuracy for featuring women soldiers in a game franchise where tanks can go flying and soldiers can jump off jets, snipe someone's head and land back inside the cockpit"
,Trump also doesn’t believe in global warning and that’s been scientifically proven. He just doesn’t believe in science period.
,Am I the only one who wants to puke when I see or hear Donald Trump? I legit get sick
,why is Trump blaming video games maybe if they made gun laws then shootings won't happen
,Saint Donald Jesus Trump Christ is right.Four more years.
,I knew Gamergate would be number one.  
,"It was SUCH an impactful moment in gaming and the first time I really felt attacked for my gender just for existing in gaming spaces.  Simple things, like calling out inequality (not being able to play a different gender in an RPG game with CC, for example), letting female and male employees speak about sexual harassment in their place of work, grossly sexist themes in the games itself that alienated groups of its playerbases being called out - all of that was suddenly made death threat worthy.  And I mean actual THREATS on peoples' lives (if you didn't follow it).  It was so disgusting and really removed me from the gaming community (not the games lol, I could never leave those) as a (at the time) fairly young, impressionable teenage girl."
PkhVybrCMks,"Gamergate aswell as Gaming Disorder shows how major parts of the gaming community are still very defensive and playing gatekeepers when the medium is critisized. Guys time to grow up. Gaming is a mass phenomenon and as such has issues and problems to deal with, some of which include topics you don't want to hear about or stay ignorant of their existence. That does not change the fact that these issues exist and that also people outside the gaming world can have a say about them and are not inherently wrong. "

s5EigVsM_OI,"If anyone wants to know how it’s a walkout on fut, I think I found it out on the beta, when the packs opens the animation will b zoomed out more than just a normal rare gold player"

s5EigVsM_OI,I KNEW CASTRO WOULD MISS THE OPEN GOAL AHAHAHAHA! > 4:45
s5EigVsM_OI,Haha this is gonna be a fun mode
s5EigVsM_OI,I think people forget that passing boosts affects FK accuracy and curve.
s5EigVsM_OI,The main questions: is dynamic difficulty and scripting still in the game?
s5EigVsM_OI,bateson the dribbling boost gives 5star skills to everyone
s5EigVsM_OI,Is this actually fifa 17 ? I do not see any difference :_D
s5EigVsM_OI,Anyone know the song in the backround at the start of the video

s5EigVsM_OI,"Castro is so gringy and toxic now, he used to be cool :,|"
s5EigVsM_OI,"On dribbling boost, the player who has the ball get 5 star skill moves"
s5EigVsM_OI,Can you low driven in fifa 20? And is it op?
s5EigVsM_OI,How to know is it 2 or1 goal?
s5EigVsM_OI,Castro talks a lot
s5EigVsM_OI,You have a beard? There is a first for everything
s5EigVsM_OI,4:45 WTF just happened ???
s5EigVsM_OI,Castro's top 4 has my team wolves in it I'd love that but its not likely is he a fan of wolves because of jiminez
s5EigVsM_OI,12:48 that goal
s5EigVsM_OI,Is the fire freekick in every freekick or is it just in this mode?
s5EigVsM_OI,You can do this on Fifa 19??
s5EigVsM_OI,Best modeee?!?? Broken mode..
s5EigVsM_OI,Actually fun to watch gameplay
s5EigVsM_OI,How do you do that flex celebration? 7:24
s5EigVsM_OI,I used dribbling boost on navas and I could do advanced rainbow flick All 5 star skills hocus pouch reverse and normal elastico ETC.
s5EigVsM_OI,Castro is the worst
s5EigVsM_OI,and i thought castro couldnt be more cringeworthy... intentionally misses an open goal and acts like a kid... ksi 2.0 sellout
s5EigVsM_OI,Can you turn that little ball trail of?
s5EigVsM_OI,Is there a way of muting Mexican people before I watch anymore
s5EigVsM_OI,I wish one of you two could ask EA to make an Icon XI in kick off modes which have all the icons in one team with reserves as icons. If this came to the game it would be so cool with this game mode and players like me who can’t get icons could have more fun. Please ask Bateson
s5EigVsM_OI,15:00 the goal that score Castro it counts for two goals if you don't see that
s5EigVsM_OI,Fifa 20 gameplay looks so robotic and shitty!
s5EigVsM_OI,Leave video at 4:47
s5EigVsM_OI,I wonder if the dribbling boost gives your player more skill moves or not
s5EigVsM_OI,Hungary

s5EigVsM_OI,This Mistery game mode is awesome
s5EigVsM_OI,You laugh at bateson’s weight

s5EigVsM_OI,CASINO
s5EigVsM_OI,Game destroyers

s5EigVsM_OI,Lol
s5EigVsM_OI,R.I.P EA SPORTS FIFA
s5EigVsM_OI,Its only a dab why do u have to be so mad
s5EigVsM_OI,The 2 most annoying youtubers on earth

s5EigVsM_OI,???? ?????? ???? ????
s5EigVsM_OI,Calvo!!!
s5EigVsM_OI,Suckers
s5EigVsM_OI,"Have to say PES 20 looks like a real game on TV unlike this. This reminds me of the old, same run+dribble FIFA-franchise. "
s5EigVsM_OI,"Best career mode wins me over though, but I think PES will win there also."
s5EigVsM_OI,Castro is bad
s5EigVsM_OI,Can’t wait for FIFA 20! I am clearly a top 100 player already.......
s5EigVsM_OI,"EA: ""one-on-one finishing will be more clinical in FIFA 20 and keepers will be less powerful."" Well this video proved that was a lie"

eUuSpqbHmPc,excellent. I really enjoy watching soccer. :D
eUuSpqbHmPc,The setup touch is definitely not a game changing skill.
eUuSpqbHmPc,Maybe if you have your cpu difficulty set to amateur like you have here then that's the only time you can call it game changing.
eUuSpqbHmPc,Great tutorial man keep up the good work !??
eUuSpqbHmPc,Can't wait for the finesse shot tutorial ?
eUuSpqbHmPc,"ovvy next you should do a video on how to defence with all this skills,especially the croqueta ?"

eUuSpqbHmPc,Hi ovvy please reply
eUuSpqbHmPc,is my man playing on demo??
eUuSpqbHmPc,Great intro man ??
eUuSpqbHmPc,You should do a tutorial for the volta skill moves and for the new passes
eUuSpqbHmPc,Drag to drag mo salah top right bins ?
eUuSpqbHmPc,Impossible to watch at 1.0 speed
eUuSpqbHmPc,Aint got a xbox or ps4
eUuSpqbHmPc,Still watching xD
eUuSpqbHmPc,Let's gooo
eUuSpqbHmPc,Ovvy makes another stunning video ...
eUuSpqbHmPc,What is player relative in fifa 20 settings?
eUuSpqbHmPc,you HAVE to watch this guy on speed x2 x'D 
eUuSpqbHmPc,All of a sudden he talks normal
eUuSpqbHmPc,Thx bro!keeep it up??
eUuSpqbHmPc,Ovy notisquad
eUuSpqbHmPc,In fifa every player Moving the same hhhhhh no individuality
eUuSpqbHmPc,There’s another trick I tried and it really worked. You take out the disk and put it back in the case and sell it and buy pes instead. It changed my life really.
eUuSpqbHmPc,You need 1m subs
eUuSpqbHmPc,Helpful and simple tutorial tbh
eUuSpqbHmPc,What do you do with L3 when you shoot?
eUuSpqbHmPc,do you and krassi have any plans on having friendly gameplay with followers in friendly fut mode?
eUuSpqbHmPc,so you turn the timed finished off? huh?
eUuSpqbHmPc,You can actually use setup touch as Cruyff turn
eUuSpqbHmPc,Bravo ?
eUuSpqbHmPc,Ovvy on fire today ??
eUuSpqbHmPc,BRRRUUHHH
eUuSpqbHmPc,Do you think that these skill moves are must for a ST on Pro Clubs?
eUuSpqbHmPc,Congrats for 600k
eUuSpqbHmPc,GREAT VID BRO CANT WAIT FOR FIFA 20
eUuSpqbHmPc,Can you do a Panna a lot easier?
eUuSpqbHmPc,"Very nice vid mate, sadly tho when I apply those in career mode on legendary or ultimate difficulty, none of those seems to be slightly as effective as you demonstrate in the video.  AI will always successfully tackle my player with unrealistic reflex or simply knock my player to the ground with no foul."
eUuSpqbHmPc,If it works that well it will get nerfed
eUuSpqbHmPc,how do you do la croquetta now then?
eUuSpqbHmPc,ameizing
eUuSpqbHmPc,"The L1/LB fake shot is also extremely overpowered. In fifa 20 if u manage to get past a defender u are through on goal, with that speed boost you can get behind a defender so easily."
eUuSpqbHmPc,"Hi, can you be of any help Mike third kits are is missing in my FIFA 20. What do i do ?"
eUuSpqbHmPc,Your best person for tips on fifa20 cos you I am winning more games and controlling my gameplay more much respect love happiness dennisoswin from UK

eUuSpqbHmPc,Setup touch increases chanche of scoring
eUuSpqbHmPc,Love ya vids
eUuSpqbHmPc,Has anyone been able to score at least 1 goal from a header???
eUuSpqbHmPc,"The set up is BRILLIANT for shielding the ball too, since you can push it to either side of the defender and then either shield it or wiggle your way into open space"
eUuSpqbHmPc,Ovvy is back and better than ever lets goooo
eUuSpqbHmPc,Do you think the berba spin will be good this year
eUuSpqbHmPc,"One thing I’ve noticed in the demo is the keeper palms the ball through the middle to much which is gonna be an issue, I’m sure they will fix it because those goals are so undeserved and everybody will hate them regardless could be abused in fact"
eUuSpqbHmPc,coaie tu nici macar nu stii sa joci fifa 20 si faci tutoriale :))
eUuSpqbHmPc,Why cant i do dragback in fifa 20
eUuSpqbHmPc,"cant listen anymore , unsub..."
eUuSpqbHmPc,Will we be seeing you in fifa competitions ovie?? You are better than half the guys
eUuSpqbHmPc,"I am not first, I am not last, but when I receive notification, I click fast"

eUuSpqbHmPc,You have esi
eUuSpqbHmPc,Frate te rog frumos sa faci un tutorial in romana si mai explicit despre cum sa dai finesse shot ca tot nu inteleg cum trebuie
eUuSpqbHmPc,I don’t understand how to do the set up touch
eUuSpqbHmPc,Krassi with hair
eUuSpqbHmPc,To be honest the 1st one is quite useless
eUuSpqbHmPc,Who’s from Toronto ???
eUuSpqbHmPc,The controls are different on the demo. Why is this? and do they change for the real game?
eUuSpqbHmPc,"Mul?umim pentru tutoriale, man. Apreciez munca ta si calitatea con?inutului pe care ni-l livrezi. Pace! ?"
eUuSpqbHmPc,You should not be saying what is op and what isn't based on the demo. Many things can change in the final version.
eUuSpqbHmPc,lol waste of money people wait untill it goes on sale
eUuSpqbHmPc,Please give me ps4 pro
eUuSpqbHmPc,Frate si in engleza ai success... Well done???

I would watch something called MMD and I would watch the randomness in it and it would have the models dance just like the computer models on Goldeneye 007. I remember playing that game in the past and having so much trouble trying to play it because I was so young at the time and didn't know what to do except shoot people and not get blasted to death by machines that were  hanging from the ceiling and that's where I would die and I never knew what ""save"" ""Continue"" and/or ""options"" meant until I played The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for about 6 years and lost both copies of Goldeneye 007 (because I had 2 games and idk why XD) and I would always call that game ""Spy game"" or ""secret guy game"" XD and there be times where my speech was way off and it sounded like I said ""secret gay game"" and my mother would look at me weirdly but surprised and say ""when did you get a game like that?!"" xD the memories are priceless!

bAl-xp6fYDo,Same commentary from 2K15 - 2K19 ?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Use me as a: Not gonna buy it. Button
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k needs competition.  This the same gameplay as last year
bAl-xp6fYDo,Getting pretty tired to hear Kevin Harlan & Greg Anthony
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Robots moving up and down, ball stitched to the hand on the fast break runs dribble, skating... welcome to NBA2K9"
bAl-xp6fYDo,2K NEEDS NEW COMMENTARY!!
bAl-xp6fYDo,Wow crazy I was playing 19 and Lebron cutscene came on and he said the exact same thing amazing
bAl-xp6fYDo,Get rid of that style of halftime show. Their interactions are so cringe :(
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Everytime 2k releases an updated ver each year, I pray EA gets their shit right"
bAl-xp6fYDo,WE WANT MIKE BREEN COMMENTARY BANG!
bAl-xp6fYDo,Bruh it still looks clunky as hell
bAl-xp6fYDo,Really like I don’t know what to say. Just a couple of years ago I would look at something like this and be like are you kidding me??? You mean this is a video game. Incredible. 
bAl-xp6fYDo,But technology is so good that I am with you guys at this point.  I’m ready for better graphics. I don’t know if we’re just asking too much at this point though. 10 years ago this type of stuff would have blown my mind. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Ball & Rondo hitting 3’s? it has to be on Rookie Difficulty ??
bAl-xp6fYDo,Is it just me or there are a lot of sliding happening?
bAl-xp6fYDo,I had to score “57” with Giannis to beat the Pelicans Lol this is insane lol
bAl-xp6fYDo,danny green misses the 3 and lonzo ball hits all net? BULSH*T!
bAl-xp6fYDo,When I played this I seriously thought this is 2K19. Everything is the same. Good thing I pirated this.
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k not really working hard anymore..and we can thank nba live for that
bAl-xp6fYDo,nab 2k19 dlc
bAl-xp6fYDo,Yo Brandon Ingrams speed rating is at “79” and he faster then anybody you can think of? and I’m not joking!!!! Lol. Unbelievable!!! Lol
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Can we have Reggie ""Welcome to your Kodak moment"" Miller instead of Barry and Greg Anthony? They just sound flat to me, doesn't add intensity to the game"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Same ass game every year
bAl-xp6fYDo,"They need to get rid of that one sus ass announcer, mans always talking about how good the d is.??"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Don't know what yall talking about I love this game. Or it could be that I haven't owned a copy of this game for a long time now but 2K is just so more in depth I can't wait till the football come out
bAl-xp6fYDo,Yall better enjoy the game now before the PATCHES are released. 2k always plays the best out the box
bAl-xp6fYDo,"1:40 Rondo (like him, Allegra's older brother from Nick Jr's Allegra's Window)"
bAl-xp6fYDo,"If anyone buys it, just get it during black Friday. $25 usually??"
bAl-xp6fYDo,2:14 anyone hear that AHHH?
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Caruso, Green, Bron, AD, Howard or McGee based on center matchup should start. Lakers need someone with size and length that gives EFFORT at starting PG spot. And Caruso shot well from 3. Kuz, McGee/Howard, Bradley, Cook, and KCP off the bench. Rondo, Daniels and Dudley should be emergency guys or guys who get minutes during back to backs or load management games."
bAl-xp6fYDo,"I really find it fantastic as a video game, seeing it as if I was watching real NBA game!"
bAl-xp6fYDo,"A REALIDADE DO JOGO É INCRÍVEL, QUE GRÁFICO!!"
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Definitely improved lighting and color scheme, looks very realistic now. All they need is to add the arena sounds especially the Lakers Organ playing. That would add maximum arena feel"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Where tf is Dwight?
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Everytime 2k releases an updated ver each year, I pray EA gets their shit right"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Soooo its exactly the same as 2k19? Ok
bAl-xp6fYDo,Looks like nothing changed at all. It still the same gameplay of 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k19 with roster update
bAl-xp6fYDo,?????????
bAl-xp6fYDo,Look like 2k19 guess I'll save my money and update the rosters ?
bAl-xp6fYDo,this game made me realize whose gonna be the 1st offensive option on the Pelicans?
bAl-xp6fYDo,1:55 that Lavar run by Zion ?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Weird animation...
bAl-xp6fYDo,i love the graphics ....but somewhere is feel it need some glitch-fixed in movement
bAl-xp6fYDo,The best part of the game was the commentary. Expected more excitement
bAl-xp6fYDo,Herky Jerky???
bAl-xp6fYDo,"always camera bug during breaks , robotic movement too ... ? 2k19.5"
bAl-xp6fYDo,2:56 was some heat ??
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Everytime 2k releases an updated ver each year, I pray EA gets their shit right"
bAl-xp6fYDo,"will they remove the ""ninja style headwear"" that has been banned by the NBA?"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Awesome match ever I have seen
bAl-xp6fYDo,Amazing
bAl-xp6fYDo,19:40 - Should've dished off to Kuzma... but we move.
bAl-xp6fYDo,I LOVE IT

bAl-xp6fYDo,Great graphics almost thought it was real
bAl-xp6fYDo,2:08 Ball (like Balls) (from Sports)

bAl-xp6fYDo,Tahnkfully i did not buy these it’s the same as 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,How can I turn off the percentage numbers that appear bellow the players? Thanks!
bAl-xp6fYDo,Somehow this looks worse
bAl-xp6fYDo,Dang it...it's Kevin Harlan and Greg again. When can we ever get Real commentary. But at least Kevin Harlan was in the Raptors playoffs Game 7 Phila game TNT.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Wheres the cheerleaders at
bAl-xp6fYDo,I guess I'll download rosters on 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,Graphics look like a combo of 2k14 and  2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,Soooo its exactly the same as 2k19? Ok
bAl-xp6fYDo,Bro. I have a problem of the commentary audio. It is still low even when I turned it up to full volume. Do you have any idea how to fix this? I am using PS4 also.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"New rosters, new hype but the exact same game."
bAl-xp6fYDo,graphic feels like 2k13 pc lool
bAl-xp6fYDo,Do you still have to qualify to use the all time teams to play on line?

bAl-xp6fYDo,Looks so REAL and the gameplay has already been good if they fix online lag
bAl-xp6fYDo,movement doesnt look smooth
bAl-xp6fYDo,I'm glad i'm not alone. I ain't paying $59.99 for the same game since 2K15. I'd wait for the $19.99 price point
bAl-xp6fYDo,Much better graphics than NBA live 95
bAl-xp6fYDo,me here playin 2k in my phone.

bAl-xp6fYDo,That was a very tough match
bAl-xp6fYDo,Lol y'all get what y'all pay for  ah huh I'm waiting on 2k
bAl-xp6fYDo,I still play 2k13 on ps3 lol
bAl-xp6fYDo,Bruh the commentary repeats the same thinggggggg cmon 2k
bAl-xp6fYDo,They really need to incorporate a realism mode where live injuries are applied in the game.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Why we don't hear Arena Sounds (Organ, buzz)? It's the same with NBA Live 19. I'm a casual player and I play the game for atmosphere."
bAl-xp6fYDo,This is why i play 2k14 lmao
bAl-xp6fYDo,2K has Maddenitis --------------- Enjoy 2K world your 3% upgraded game from last year.....
bAl-xp6fYDo,"What 2K should I buy? I’m looking to understand the NBA a little more in a fun way, while maintaining great graphics."

bAl-xp6fYDo,"So after Luke Walton got let go, Brian Shaw gave up his coaching career for this 7:10?"
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k Needs New Commentary
bAl-xp6fYDo,2nd Half should begin with Lakers Twin Towers = JaVale McGee or Dwight Howard at Center. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,"That's why you got Lob Dunks over poor defender, Kyle Kuzma."
bAl-xp6fYDo,It kinda looks NBA live
bAl-xp6fYDo,I dont have commentary how to fix it?
bAl-xp6fYDo,ESPN should bring back nba game
bAl-xp6fYDo,Imma just download a pirated one so I can't waste money

bAl-xp6fYDo,Everything went downhill after 2k14.
bAl-xp6fYDo,the commentary never changed. tsk
bAl-xp6fYDo,No competition equals same gameplay. Live please make a game. But 2k just need tweaks. I actually think it’s good this year.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Oh yeah AD have what he deserve at 2:55 by Zion

bAl-xp6fYDo,Can anybody tell me why the background commentators on 2k20 dont work?
bAl-xp6fYDo,The best thing about 2k20 is the WNBA?
bAl-xp6fYDo,I don't want to buy 2k20 i will just  update my roaster on 2k19?? i am waiting for durant and clay to play again and i will.connect it.again on the internet..
bAl-xp6fYDo,Wait til Black Friday
bAl-xp6fYDo,"I thought they will put realistic PA announcer that im waiting for since nba 2k12 but im wrong, same boring not realistic PA announcer.. this the missing piece 2k!!!"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Fully graphic and on point
bAl-xp6fYDo,I have a problem homies my 2k20 does not have commentary sound but it is not updated yet though
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k Is To NBA As EA Is To NFL. Same Game Every Year.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Impressionante os arremessos
bAl-xp6fYDo,waaaw...
bAl-xp6fYDo,Look like robots moving jumpshots look good tho
bAl-xp6fYDo,nba 2k18 19 20 dlc
bAl-xp6fYDo,They need new commentary like marv albert reggie miller Mike Breen Jeff van Gundy
bAl-xp6fYDo,The graphics aren’t gonna look any better until there’s a new system 2k can only do so much
bAl-xp6fYDo,Run & Gun 2 Arcade still the best basketball game ever made.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Other classics In the conversation = NBA Jam TE , NBA Hangtime etc..."
bAl-xp6fYDo,This game is going to be fun playing
bAl-xp6fYDo,Same commentary from 2K15
bAl-xp6fYDo,Whoever controlled the Pelicans was pure trash. What the hell you have 0% gaming skill. Lmao
bAl-xp6fYDo,Excellent gameplay
bAl-xp6fYDo,Why is it my commentators are not speaking??
bAl-xp6fYDo,good to see
bAl-xp6fYDo,Bro am i the only one that cant use the injury free roster
bAl-xp6fYDo,Wtf no Lakers girls??? I'm done
bAl-xp6fYDo,"2k are too lazy to assign the correct free throw animation to all players, Kuzma only dribble one's when he shoot free throw.  Parquet floor colors are incorrect and the wood  still looks like a watercolor."
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Ok this 2k fine but im noticing its like nba live a little, the servers suck everytime i try to turn my players attributes up server error, the double teaming and constant blocking is annoying, u dont have full control over dribbling i take my thumb off the right stick im still dribbling"
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Avery Bradley is a OFF-THE-BALL player and better perimeter defender the Rajon Rondo = better 1st Unit  Team Chemistry with Lebron than Rondo, who is an ON-THE-BALL player."
bAl-xp6fYDo,R.I.P KOBE BRYAN AND GIANNA!
bAl-xp6fYDo,I think I want to play this game
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Trash, 2k is stealing money, people stop buying this piece of trash game every year."
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice video indeed.
bAl-xp6fYDo,maybe its just minor but 2k needs to add technical fouls on this game..an option where you can complain on the ref regarding on the foul call... you play 82 games long and you didnt even have a technical foul? wtf
bAl-xp6fYDo,Very enjoyable game!!!!!
bAl-xp6fYDo,They should use another engine. Players moving rough like in FIFA 15.
bAl-xp6fYDo,I can understand 2k fans frustration
bAl-xp6fYDo,Why is it yours is very smooth? Mine is a little bit lag and stuttering. Especially in the jump ball and when the crowds are very loud on crucial moments. I’m using a PS4 pro
bAl-xp6fYDo,they just changed 19 to 20 and teams updates. All other things are same. Do not buy!
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Davis,the real Lakers leader!!!who think like me support me."
bAl-xp6fYDo,They still look like they gliding on the court and floating in the air !! I’m tired of that robot type feel !! Example 2:56 when LB and AD go for the rebound smh 2k
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice gameplay quality
bAl-xp6fYDo,For those that are wondering it’s a little better than 2k19 I should make a video but it’s enough vids out there for this game hyping the hell out of it my advice rent it from redbox first.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Graphics may be better but gameplay can never be the same like the old games
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k please football game
bAl-xp6fYDo,Woww
bAl-xp6fYDo,nice video and i love this game
bAl-xp6fYDo,???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Great game
bAl-xp6fYDo,YOU ARE THE BEST NBA 2K20 AND I LOVE U
bAl-xp6fYDo,Cool video. Nice gameplay.
bAl-xp6fYDo,No Howard?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Is it just me or does everyone think that no arena announcer and all the other chants not being there make the game sound empty
bAl-xp6fYDo,Same Like 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,a repetition  but go lakers!!
bAl-xp6fYDo,you can tell people don't understand how graphics work
bAl-xp6fYDo,I dont have commentary why is that can you help me fix it
bAl-xp6fYDo,"mine doesn't have commentary, does it need a update?"
bAl-xp6fYDo,SO WE GONNA IGNORE 2:50 ???!!!?!!? THAT WAS CRAZYYYY
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Are these jerseys not on MyCareer mode? I got drafted by the lakers and I’ve only seen the white home jerseys, never the gold ones yet"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Commenter speech good
bAl-xp6fYDo,Is it still hard to pass the defense to dunk and what not like 2k19 or is it better this year let me kno guys cause if so I’m not buying it ?????
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nba live 09.   When the games close.  The crowd sound chanting.  Defense. Thomp thomp.  Defense. Thomp thomp.   Was so realistic it felt like i was at a game.   Whats this shit.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"I don't like the graphics much,it doesn't look realistic.2k14 is the real deal."
bAl-xp6fYDo,"As of bad reviews I bought 2k14 for pc, cuz many say it has the best graphics (at least till 2k19)."
bAl-xp6fYDo,But to me it seems 2k20 looks better.
bAl-xp6fYDo,How is 2k20 when it comes to AI?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Kobe ;(
bAl-xp6fYDo,Gameplay is different for sure bet this guys who says it’s the same is using lebron and pressing sprint to the basket or doesn’t have the game at all
bAl-xp6fYDo,Where are the short shorts?!
bAl-xp6fYDo,waaw...
bAl-xp6fYDo,People still buying 2k ?? not buying 2k till ps5 come out. Done with these graphics.
bAl-xp6fYDo,good video....i like this
bAl-xp6fYDo,Yall complaing but prolly spent $60.00 on bs on the regular!! It's not easy to put together an effective and efficient new engine every year. Look how long is it's taking like to put out a decent game!!
bAl-xp6fYDo,They move funny
bAl-xp6fYDo,great
bAl-xp6fYDo,How does LeBron get player of the game and he barley did anything impactful
bAl-xp6fYDo,"U know what, i’ll just wait for nba live20"
bAl-xp6fYDo,At least i get to try somethin new??
bAl-xp6fYDo,"If Lonzo is NOT ON-THE-BALL immediately after rebounds, this is bogus. ???"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Why have Jrue Holiday ON-THE-BALL ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Put Holiday back at 1-spot and start SHARPSHOOTER J.J. Redick.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Jogo de basquete de sp4 legal.
bAl-xp6fYDo,the movement are so cartoon ish
bAl-xp6fYDo,Same commentary smh
bAl-xp6fYDo,well ive been getting NBA 2k for like  the last  5 years.. not sure i will this season... i havent seen everything yet but i assume its all the same.. the hoopscast sim setup i bet is the same... i wish they would bring back normal coach mode and not the  stupid  hoopscast live sim thing with the  birdseye view and the dots running around..
bAl-xp6fYDo,Drive Club wins
bAl-xp6fYDo,nice match..
bAl-xp6fYDo,NBA 2K20 PS4 is the graphic and super mass.
bAl-xp6fYDo,That shot meter is ??
bAl-xp6fYDo,très fort jaime bien le design du jeux
bAl-xp6fYDo,3:30 weird hahaha
bAl-xp6fYDo,The moves looks like nba live??I stay with 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,Game really stays the same but somehow gets a lil worst every year
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Getting this on sale, haven’t played since 17"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Running animation looks better
bAl-xp6fYDo,Fantastic
bAl-xp6fYDo,Muito real
bAl-xp6fYDo,Everybody is talking about the gameplay being the same but last last year yall said it was good or playable so why would 2k change it plus people r Moore focus on my career n mypark modes more than just  regular gameplay so that's what 2k is focus more on.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Anthony Davis doesn't play Center until the 2nd Half = more realistic. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,I hate how they always put same dunks at the game i play 2k14 those are the same dunks damnn too bad lazy
bAl-xp6fYDo,nice play
bAl-xp6fYDo,graphic nice but them face animation tho like dead
bAl-xp6fYDo,Crazy
bAl-xp6fYDo,Graphics is getting better for me better than 2k14 already body build are ryt already and face scan.. But for the sake of basketball.. Change the old commentary already.. Its the same thing all over again
bAl-xp6fYDo,This game has looked the exact same for 5 years damn
bAl-xp6fYDo,fine video
bAl-xp6fYDo,Why does the game look worse
bAl-xp6fYDo,Prob keeping my free digital copy of 2k19
bAl-xp6fYDo,This isn't NBA 2K20
bAl-xp6fYDo,This is NOT gameplay. This is AI vs AI showtime.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Fix the defense
bAl-xp6fYDo,hello
bAl-xp6fYDo,Jogo manero
bAl-xp6fYDo,I need to get 2k20 I been playing gta 5 it’s getting old af
bAl-xp6fYDo,They just add (change to) new rosters and sell the game like A brand NEW.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Zion doesn't get to the basket OFF-THE-DRIBBLE from outside the Free Throw line against 2 Laker Shot-blockers. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Unrealistic asf
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,This game is so backwards. Whoever made this game needs to actually watch basketball. Like c'mon now. At the half they interview the wackest players. Every game I play instead of them interviewing the player with the most points they interview the player with 2 points. SMFH. The other day I played online and some dude hit 2 swish 3's with rodman. And that's cause they suck the old school players dicks so rodman is able to hit 3's. SMFH. This game is turning into nba live. I'm soon gonna stop playing this shit.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,very good
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice game?
bAl-xp6fYDo,this is the wrong starting lineup for the lakers demarcus cousins should be the 5 AD should be the 4 and lebron should be the 3 danny should be the 1 and kuz should be the 2
bAl-xp6fYDo,Good game
bAl-xp6fYDo,This game looks the same an whoever playing is trash
bAl-xp6fYDo,Same trash every year everyone reading this don't buy.
bAl-xp6fYDo,My question is why are black guys seating in Jack Nicholson chair?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Anthony Davis was originally a POINT GUARD before sudden growth spurt. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Should be a Top of Key as your 3rd ballhandler if Lebron and Rondo on the court together = only role for Danny Green is Catch & Shoot. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Green better touch the ball in Transition Offense, EXCEPT TRANSITION 3-POINTERS."
bAl-xp6fYDo,good
bAl-xp6fYDo,Personally I only buy sports games every 2-3 years. Last 2k I bought was 18. I see a significant upgrade in graphics in 2k20. I like how smooth it looks
bAl-xp6fYDo,"If Boogie Cousins is healthy = automatic Twin Towers with Anthony Davis, NOT JAVALE MCGEE. ???"
bAl-xp6fYDo,nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,Game mechanics trash lul
bAl-xp6fYDo,They put gay cheerleaders.    Wtf.  The guy is hobblin n wigglin.   The world is over.   Wtf
bAl-xp6fYDo,good
bAl-xp6fYDo,Nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,Dont like the graphics
bAl-xp6fYDo,Did they take the laker girls out the game?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Who plays with this camera angle??? no one I know.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"The things I like: Floor Reflections, Head Ties, and Rosters"
bAl-xp6fYDo,The things I don't: No major graphical or audible improvement along with the gameplay :(
bAl-xp6fYDo,nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,beau match
bAl-xp6fYDo,people still buy this gambling game? LOL I think id rather go to vegas id save more money
bAl-xp6fYDo,blazers vs nuggets
bAl-xp6fYDo,Only kids and those who are not 2k elite play with 2k camera I'm srry but 2k camera always sucked last time I played 2k camera was the original first ever 2k!
bAl-xp6fYDo,Bro I ain’t played sideways since the original PlayStation ? I just can’t do it ??
bAl-xp6fYDo,"2k games make it really difficult to dominate the perimeter. Guys like AD and KD don’t have to work to get open, they just rise up over defense. Can’t do that in a 2k game, it’s all about the around the basket gameplay"
bAl-xp6fYDo,Great Game ?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Played The Demo and The Gameplay Is Not Better than Playing 2K18 on Xbox360 sorry lmfao I still ball on 2K
bAl-xp6fYDo,"2k is getting so lazy. They know people will still buy it. This is just bad. Slow motion movements, getting stuck in animation sequences. Same boring ass commentary. If we could all just stop giving them money MAYBE they'll start to care again. 2k used to be so great. Truly a shame."
bAl-xp6fYDo,This looks like the same gameplay from nba 2k5 lol honest....
bAl-xp6fYDo,Zion don't run like that what
bAl-xp6fYDo,Horrible halftime show and  the AI is off. They almost never find the player ahead on the break. Why no fast breaking???
bAl-xp6fYDo,"the court is boring.. the lighting in the court is ugly.. honestly, 2k15 is better.,."
bAl-xp6fYDo,2k getting worse and worse every year. They've reached they're prime  a few years back but slowly declined over the years. if you ask me they started slipping around 2k12-14. Sooner than later 2k will cause it's own destruction the same way NBA Live & EA had it's run from NBA live 2000- to NBA Live 10.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Where is the penguin-like run of zion???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Where is Howard?
bAl-xp6fYDo,Very nice video
bAl-xp6fYDo,Is it worth $60 somebody let me know
bAl-xp6fYDo,Hello. I have a problem on my game. There's no commentator in the game. Not even working in settings. I just installed the game a while ago cause i just bought it earlier. I can play but the features are still downloading. Why is there no commentator? Please help thanks.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Damn
bAl-xp6fYDo,Very nice game
bAl-xp6fYDo,very nice
bAl-xp6fYDo,This game is garbage
bAl-xp6fYDo,Graphics looking better than I expected
bAl-xp6fYDo,What about xbox
bAl-xp6fYDo,Y do they run like they do....man omg 2k is trash.......I'm glad I am not waisting my money on this trash any more.....dam...they just really pissed me the f off....2k20 should have been the best ever
bAl-xp6fYDo,It's like watching a real game
bAl-xp6fYDo,boring
bAl-xp6fYDo,Speed game is terrible.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Trash
bAl-xp6fYDo,First  
bAl-xp6fYDo,Hi
bAl-xp6fYDo,"TRASH at its best,horrible graphics,no improvement from last year.Whoever drop $60 for this,you are sick.TRASH!"
bAl-xp6fYDo,That's not realistic...
bAl-xp6fYDo,Rondo is not an OFF-THE-BALL PLAYER. ???
bAl-xp6fYDo,Doesn't belong on the court at the same time as Lebron James.
bAl-xp6fYDo,"Rondo's value is as an ON-THE-BALL PLAYER = same as Lebron, but there is only 1 ball."
bAl-xp6fYDo,2nd Unit Floor General is MANDATORY so Rondo can keep Dwight Howard under control.
bAl-xp6fYDo,Zion is overrated af
bAl-xp6fYDo,Trashy commentary
bAl-xp6fYDo,I personally like this game better than 19. Every game has its flaws but it's better. Honestly the biggest thing is the Tendencies are out of whack man. John Collins has like 55 shot tendency causing him to average like 10 points in sims. Doncic has 65 shot Tendency. Those are just two of many!! 
8A9Sdvppurs,ubisoft doing great cinematic trailers
8A9Sdvppurs,"For the halo 2 trailer I thought it was the original one XD. I spent most of it going ""Holy shit I don't remember the cinematic being this good looking"""
8A9Sdvppurs,"To this day ""WoW: WotLK"" Cinematic gives me chills."
8A9Sdvppurs,nearly 1 year later and for honor still looks awsome as hell
8A9Sdvppurs,Man Blizzard's trailers are so good.
8A9Sdvppurs,Woooow....Knights of the Old Republic trailer gave me fahkin chills...10/10...
8A9Sdvppurs,cyperpunk looked pretty cool. love the song..the witcher was pretty badass too
8A9Sdvppurs,"""A man can have anything if he is willing to sacrifice"""
8A9Sdvppurs,Is it just me or does Starcraft look like it would be an amazing moive as its self
8A9Sdvppurs,Blizzard never fails to impress when is comes to trailers

8A9Sdvppurs,never seen that version of the phantom menace trailer...best one yet
8A9Sdvppurs,My favourite cinematic trailer will always be Assassin's Creed Revelations. I'm surprised it wasn't in the top 20 and you went for Assassin's Creed 3 instead
8A9Sdvppurs,I feel like he's talking to 343 about their past halo entries... lol
8A9Sdvppurs,EPICNESS=HALO
8A9Sdvppurs,this is awesome please keep up the great work GAMEOST!!!

8A9Sdvppurs,Star Wars The Old Republic trailers never cease to shock and amaze me
8A9Sdvppurs,Is that Helios? (The Borderlands Games)
8A9Sdvppurs,"The Mass Effect 3 trailer wouldve been the best trailer in history if Garrus wouldve appeared in 1:00:20 and a few others (Wrex, Mordin,...) wouldve appeared after."
8A9Sdvppurs,"Before i started to watch, had in my mind, that among all trailers i watched, the best was mgs 5 phantom pain, and when this video almost ended, here it is. There is no awesome graphics in this trailer, nor catchy plot, man i don't even played any of mgs games till saw this trailer, but just music in it, thoughts that are in it, all of this makes this trailer magnificent. U can not agree with me, but for me it's 100% like that."
8A9Sdvppurs,Name of the song in Mortal Kombat X trailer ?
8A9Sdvppurs,"Estejam vigilantes, mantenham-se firmes na fé, sejam homens de coragem, sejam fortes. "

8A9Sdvppurs,Is there going to be a film on the elder Scrolls?.......would be fantastic to see.....

8A9Sdvppurs,"Meh, Dark Souls 2 is still far better than all these cinematic wise "
x94NyYrmrNc,I literally think ea sit on bean bag chairs smoking hippie crack 11 months out the year then just add a patch to fifa 19 and release that ??
x94NyYrmrNc,I'd would rather have a new fight Night then another fifa that is  same as last season
x94NyYrmrNc,"same old same old, no fluid player movements like on TV"
x94NyYrmrNc,this looks FIFA 19 to me robotic movements seems like players wet their pants ??
x94NyYrmrNc,Commentary sounds like pre-recorded garbage from 2010. There’s no flowing conversation between both commentators like in NBA 2K. No commentator would say the crap that Tyler says in this game in real life lol
x94NyYrmrNc,14:03 he's going to transform into Agent Smith
x94NyYrmrNc,Looks EXACTLY the same as fifa 19 and probably the same as 18!
x94NyYrmrNc,"Looks great and so much better than FIFA 19 haha, especially with all those new player faces!"
x94NyYrmrNc,? ? ? ? Pfft ha it's been a pleasure to watch them this season we at man u are fooked

x94NyYrmrNc,"why their movement look so clunky, its like robot"
x94NyYrmrNc,This look exactly like 2018 ....
x94NyYrmrNc,The animation seems realistic though
x94NyYrmrNc,Paul Pogba's goal got me screaming
x94NyYrmrNc,I'll stick with pro evo
x94NyYrmrNc,"Last one i played was 14 lol, much improved"
x94NyYrmrNc,Looks exactly the same
x94NyYrmrNc,Lingard giving a long ball???
x94NyYrmrNc,Bouncing the ball on the ground is perfect
x94NyYrmrNc,"Same commentary again, nothing really new added. The generic player faces are terrible."
x94NyYrmrNc,"Wow, so different to Fifa 19"
x94NyYrmrNc,"They got ian wright doing his dance but the kit is like a winning eleven version, who remembers winning eleven in japanese on a chipped playstation"
x94NyYrmrNc,"Looks pretty unrealistic in terms of passing accuracy and speed, looks unnaturally quick and perfect..."
x94NyYrmrNc,touch and control looks too perfect to be realistic too...
x94NyYrmrNc,looks like fifa19 with fifa 20 mod pack
x94NyYrmrNc,Arsenal is playing the exact formation (except Monreal) that beat United in Jan 1st.
x94NyYrmrNc,Martin Tyler and Alan smith don't even commentate anymore ?
x94NyYrmrNc,did they fix the passing?? i just started playing fifa17 and i cant pass for shit! i can score like a beast but passing and defending are impossible
x94NyYrmrNc,Nice match! ))
x94NyYrmrNc,Link pls.!
x94NyYrmrNc,Hmmm. I have FIFA 19. Don’t think I’ll shell out £50 for this somehow.
x94NyYrmrNc,I hope that Konami gets all the license.
x94NyYrmrNc,Fifa's killing virtual soccer
x94NyYrmrNc,"its just fifa 19, they could easily patch roasters and done, but no, they want money out of the fanbase, I hate that EA holds all FIFA licenses."
x94NyYrmrNc,wasn't even playing the game
x94NyYrmrNc,Why is Monreal still at the Arsenal?.
x94NyYrmrNc,camera settings?
x94NyYrmrNc,lol talk about bias behave will ya Gooner for life

x94NyYrmrNc,How do you watch the game without playing it
x94NyYrmrNc,Why Always clear weather online
x94NyYrmrNc,is this man united fans dream about?
x94NyYrmrNc,Wow this game looks amazing. Last fifa game I had was “15
x94NyYrmrNc,Disappointing game
x94NyYrmrNc,ARE YOU KIDDING ME EA SPORTS !!!!!!?????!!!?!?!?!?!?!?!
x94NyYrmrNc,Why play with the mini map???? ??
x94NyYrmrNc,these Games need to sort out the offside rule every pass you make is offside even when passing out from your own defence
x94NyYrmrNc,Loki's forehead just got bigger...0:51
x94NyYrmrNc,"check out my skill goals m8,good vid,i tried a rainbow flick goal but got a penalty lol"

x94NyYrmrNc,Gonna happen irl too
x94NyYrmrNc,This isn't fifa 20 lol its fifa 18 just modded trust me I have fifa 18 and the commentary and signs all that is exactly the same HOW DID U GUYS NOT KNOW
x94NyYrmrNc,8:45 if only he was that good
x94NyYrmrNc,FIFA 19* Gameplay - Arsenal vs Manchester United (Premier League) - FIFA 20 PS4
x94NyYrmrNc,Glad I decided not to buy this year it looks absolutely terrible. They move like Sega mega drive characters.
x94NyYrmrNc,You know FIFA 20 is broken when United win
x94NyYrmrNc,"Very fast, dont real"
x94NyYrmrNc,Who is the player in the minute 0:18??? D:
x94NyYrmrNc,wow this looks worse than 19 wtf?
x94NyYrmrNc,Looks like Fifa 2010
x94NyYrmrNc,COYG???
x94NyYrmrNc,FIFA 19.5 Patch 42 With patch notes : Same as FIFA 18
x94NyYrmrNc,This game looks disgusting. The commentary is so dull it doesn’t even sound like a flowing conversation
x94NyYrmrNc,£89 for same old rubbish
x94NyYrmrNc,So slow game for fifa20
x94NyYrmrNc,Played better than the actual man united
x94NyYrmrNc,fifa 19
x94NyYrmrNc,"i like the graphics.....but the gameplay, meh."
x94NyYrmrNc,You must be in some midlife crisis if you’re choosing pea over fifa
x94NyYrmrNc,2:31  Pretty sure Nicholas Pepe does not look like this imposter
x94NyYrmrNc,So the same commentary...not surprised..
x94NyYrmrNc,8ooooooo
x94NyYrmrNc,"Wer Deutsches hier, der bock hat auf Fifa 20?"
x94NyYrmrNc,"Audience can take selfies now, that's an improvement :p"
x94NyYrmrNc,This is fifa 19 not Fifa 20
x94NyYrmrNc,"yet another disappointment from EA fifa. With all of this technology, you would think that they would figure out how to fix this unrealistic player movement. The players move way too fast than real life.   Slow it down a little especially when the player receives the ball because more than often when a player receive the ball, they act as they're on acid or something lmao"
x94NyYrmrNc,"Why are the players so slow while doing the handshakes? They do this much quicker irl, it looks like a testimonial or legends match here"
x94NyYrmrNc,gameplay FC BARCELONA vs JUVENTUS
x94NyYrmrNc,ja bym lepiej zagra?
x94NyYrmrNc,"Player movement it’s robotic and unnatural and shots are very poor ,not realistic at all"
x94NyYrmrNc,How much is it
x94NyYrmrNc,Can u do more games of  fifa20 bcos im really like it
x94NyYrmrNc,Doesn't look an inch more natural than FIFA 12
x94NyYrmrNc,Seriously this looks exactly liks Fifa 19 i thought this was a click bait video.
x94NyYrmrNc,"Looks identical to 19, which looks identical to 18.  What a waste.  Stop making this game yearly and switch to every 2 years instead."
x94NyYrmrNc,Allways a fifa fan but Same crap just a different year. AGAIN.....When are ea gonna sort it out. Looks like a takeover for pes this year. ?
x94NyYrmrNc,Arcada
x94NyYrmrNc,EA have ruined fifa
x94NyYrmrNc,That does not look like Nicolas Pepe
x94NyYrmrNc,Y MADDEN DOESN'T LOOK AND FEEL LIKE THIS WHY MADDEN DOESN'T GET THE SUNDAY COMMENTATORS LIKE FIFA GETS THERE REGULAR GAME
x94NyYrmrNc,The drips on the camera looks terrible.
x94NyYrmrNc,"No change as expected, it's why I bought pes instead. Much better game"
x94NyYrmrNc,Ozil still not updated????? Ea is just laaazy
x94NyYrmrNc,Fifa is still the same it  is shity game pes is better because every year changing
x94NyYrmrNc,can buy the licenses that they want .. anyway they know that get the second position
x94NyYrmrNc,Im fifa fans. But Sorry. 2020 Im bought pes.
x94NyYrmrNc,Should I buy it?
x94NyYrmrNc,"ARS 0-3 MUN!?Tu me faisio marchadaros?!C'est muy horribliano!Arsenal n'est plous ce qu'il était.Mais maintenandos,il perd 3-0 face à Man United?!Booooo!Pourquoi niet ARS 3-0 MUN?Ay!Caramba!"
x94NyYrmrNc,The game is actually in Manchester 
plHrjHfTOvc,"Game looks good, but the ones playing...YIKES!"
plHrjHfTOvc,Finally they changed up the commentary. I couldn't stand another year of Emrick. But I cannot stand the scoreboard being at the bottom. I hope there's a way to change that.
plHrjHfTOvc,Ea has a networth of 37 billion dollars and they still cant take the time to put in 31 copyrighted goal horn songs
plHrjHfTOvc,Thanks for saving me 60 bucks
plHrjHfTOvc,I don’t know about the scoreboard. Looks way too flashy and nothing like an actual hockey broadcast.
plHrjHfTOvc,This looks more of an arcade style game than a realistic nhl gamd
plHrjHfTOvc,Another 60 dollar roster update
plHrjHfTOvc,"Still looks like nhl 15, take a year off build a real hockey game not just simple patches between each season"
plHrjHfTOvc,this has been the same game for over 10 years
plHrjHfTOvc,Same referee model for 100 yrs
plHrjHfTOvc,"Is the Play By Play guy on Coke, or Meth?"
plHrjHfTOvc,The strength of NHL 20 seems to be the commentary
plHrjHfTOvc,after 10 seconds listening to the commentary. I'm probably going to turn it off
plHrjHfTOvc,"I hate that ""Goal"" graphic. It's way too unrealistic."
plHrjHfTOvc,"I like the new commentary but I dont at the same time. I like the emphasis when the pucks close, but he sounds too much like NHL Hits or an NBA Jam announcer."
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks sweet the commentary is more engaging brings me back to the days of greattt save khabibulian
plHrjHfTOvc,The commentary is great but the scorebug in the bottom is way too distracting.
plHrjHfTOvc,Anyone know if you could do two player co-op season? It boggles my mind that me and my friend can't do a season together online.
plHrjHfTOvc,you really couldve changed those settings before you started the game ._.
plHrjHfTOvc,I think the new commentary guy is horrible
plHrjHfTOvc,"Haven’t bought an nhl game in 5 yrs and it’s still the same game, different players ????"
plHrjHfTOvc,Ngl the announcer sounds like jacksepticeye
plHrjHfTOvc,3:06 How most of my faceoffs go
plHrjHfTOvc,The game is way too unrealistic. Hughes should look more like a 12 year old.
plHrjHfTOvc,The new EA Sports presentation is way better than I expected
plHrjHfTOvc,"Not a huge fan of the commentary. Better than in previous years, but still not loving. Almost sounds cartoony.  I wish they'd get Jim Hughson back :("
plHrjHfTOvc,REJOICE!!! EVERYTHING ISNT ITALIC LMAO
plHrjHfTOvc,NHL 15 looks good
plHrjHfTOvc,This should be called NHL Arcade 20. People should pissed. I'am not wasting money on this.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Next Gen it needs to change, make it feel kinda new again, change up the angles and other things, it's always the same since 2008."
plHrjHfTOvc,"when you get into the slot, your supposed to use the right stick to fake out the goalie, these guys are just shooting trying the same goals from 19"
plHrjHfTOvc,Why does it look even less realistic than NHL19
plHrjHfTOvc,I really hope all these years of minimal improvement are making room for a big jump for next gen. Seriously compare this to the detail in NHL 2K10 ... and that was 10 years ago.
plHrjHfTOvc,No real goal songs. Pathetic
plHrjHfTOvc,MAKE THE GAME REAL WITH AUTHENTIC GOAL HORN AND SONGS
plHrjHfTOvc,I wish buffalo could get let me clear my throat in the game? 
plHrjHfTOvc,It would be dope if u could pick different announcers too
plHrjHfTOvc,Seems i have to edit the NHL19 roster by my self. But I definitly wont buy this version.
plHrjHfTOvc,this is one of the more refreshing game informer youtube videos ive watched. no clutter just game.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Huh. I'm kind of into James Cybulski's energy. I do find it kind of odd, though, that Ray Ferraro's apparently doubling as color and sideline."
plHrjHfTOvc,32:37 Dahlin glitches his way to the penalty box
plHrjHfTOvc,I have '19 I can't imagine why I'd bother with this? At least from this beta play I see much.
plHrjHfTOvc,How do you have updated rosters?
plHrjHfTOvc,"The movement blows, they look to stiff"
plHrjHfTOvc,"I wish the bottom graphic had slightly more information like shots on goal or something, and between faceoffs, it would be handy if it had some player statistics too."
plHrjHfTOvc,"In terms of the commentary, obviously they haven't recorded enough since this is the first year of this team, but they need to say names more frequently."
plHrjHfTOvc,"is EA SPORTS incapable of more than 15 frames per second, FFS"
plHrjHfTOvc,Wait how was Jack Hughes in this
plHrjHfTOvc,the shots and positioning of the body and legs in the players is amazing. i like it!
plHrjHfTOvc,So how do i play this on my i7 2600 with 16gb of ram?
plHrjHfTOvc,What video card do i need and what controller?
plHrjHfTOvc,Jack Hughes is in the game? I thought they had to wait til he played a game to get his rights.
plHrjHfTOvc,"I wish 2k still made hockey games,  EA needs competition"
plHrjHfTOvc,"Commentary is very energetic, although he sounds like the guy from NHL Hitz, if they were keeping Ray they should have got Gord Miller or Chris Cuthbert"
plHrjHfTOvc,I really like the scoreboard honestly. Seems so much nicer. The Goal thing reminds me of Touchdowns on SNF. Just seems really nice presentation wise.
plHrjHfTOvc,"I like to always wait a bit before I buy each EA Sports game, that way it really feels fresh and new. The last NHL game I played was 17 so this is going to be so much fun to play for me."
plHrjHfTOvc,"New commentary, thank god,   Same features and look.   Dunno if I’ll waste my money on this version.  The game needs a revamp"
plHrjHfTOvc,"The passing is weird, how do I fix it?"
plHrjHfTOvc,How were u able to get the updated rosters
plHrjHfTOvc,Their partnership end with NBC or something?
plHrjHfTOvc,Scoreboard also never fades away. Annoying!!!
plHrjHfTOvc,How’d you get the updated rosters?
plHrjHfTOvc,This will be my 1st and last nhl game. Sport looks interesting.
plHrjHfTOvc,NJ DEVILS REPRESENT!!!!!
plHrjHfTOvc,GOOD DEFENSIVE PLAY TO BREAK IT UP
plHrjHfTOvc,MOVING UP THE ICE
plHrjHfTOvc,FINALLY A WHISTLE
plHrjHfTOvc,24:56 why is simmonds going thru eichel lol
plHrjHfTOvc,Where's Doc ;(
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks same as always.
plHrjHfTOvc,full game and beta gameplay are completely different things
plHrjHfTOvc,"Looks like they just made one timers easier to score on, updated the rosters, the announcers, and the scoreboard... ?"
plHrjHfTOvc,Sort out your defence Sabres man!
plHrjHfTOvc,"I can’t play against my dad on the same console, any help?"
plHrjHfTOvc,Why is Jack Hughes in in your game and not on my game
plHrjHfTOvc,the shooting looks nice except for the couple weird one T’s but hopefully it will corrected when the full game comes out
plHrjHfTOvc,Watching this is difficult and boring. I used to love playing this until I got jaded on how no effort goes into the game year after year.
plHrjHfTOvc,"i love what they did with the commentary, i have been complaining for years, but what is it with them not yelling when they score? is it becuase its the home team and they are imitating that it’s the home commentary?"
plHrjHfTOvc,Are there new vintage logos?
plHrjHfTOvc,Full team celebrations at least ?
plHrjHfTOvc,"Last time i play a NHL game was NHL 2009, so more than 10 years ago, and this gameplay looks to me the same."
plHrjHfTOvc,Needs to stop going outta play when u hammer it looks like u can score more with wristshots
plHrjHfTOvc,"Looks good to me but I don’t like the goal animation, I wish the scoreboard would just say the word goal on it like before, and also it seems they didn’t really update the goal horns very much and still no goal songs"
plHrjHfTOvc,Feel like it’s a little there’s to much energy in the commentary where it should be more laid back 
plHrjHfTOvc,If you watch regular season nhl games the commentaries more laid back and in a talking voice 
plHrjHfTOvc,"The presentation is yikes at best. The commentary is also awful, I mean he’s more exciting but it still doesn’t sound anything like a normal human forming sentences. These idiots really can’t do anything right, can they?"
plHrjHfTOvc,Why don't they bring the game back to PC at least you could have ultra realistic graphics!
plHrjHfTOvc,Aye! Go Sabres! Somebody please help our depressed fan base!
plHrjHfTOvc,"There really does need to be a whole revamp of the experience of the game. From the announcers, presentation, to the crowds arena's and music. They have gotten the ai and the gameplay improved but everything else feels so stale and even this new commentator doesn't seem to have new things to say just repeating the old saying in a more energetic fashion."
plHrjHfTOvc,"NHL 11 vibes , I’m with it"
plHrjHfTOvc,LET'S GO BUFF-A-LO!
plHrjHfTOvc,Can't stand people who play with the game speed like this smh doesn't even look realistic
plHrjHfTOvc,This game looks great
plHrjHfTOvc,Thanks for saving me the money of not buying a brand new console and NHL 20.
plHrjHfTOvc,"I started playing NHL 12, stopped playing after '17 - ain't coming back now."
plHrjHfTOvc,In NHL 21 they should put The final countdown and howling for you back in the soundtrack! As well as zamboni mode
plHrjHfTOvc,Seems like the same every year
plHrjHfTOvc,Same generic music for years
plHrjHfTOvc,So I guess the goaltenders don't have names then? Just he makes a great save?
plHrjHfTOvc,Look at a copy and paste from the year before very shocking from EA .. oh wait they do that every year
plHrjHfTOvc,So new commentary and roster update and that's it?. I hear 400 new goalie animations so now online goalies are not bugged. Still no changes to Be A Pro?. So much potential for Be A Pro but it's a nothing mode.
plHrjHfTOvc,how’d you get hughes subban and simmonds on the devils
plHrjHfTOvc,"Again, no real goal songs, and announcer the same. Coooooooool"
plHrjHfTOvc,What time zone are you in
plHrjHfTOvc,I miss Doc
plHrjHfTOvc,How did you get jack Hughes on your team? The rosters are the same as last year for me
plHrjHfTOvc,"are we playing hockey or football, what’s with that scoreboard"
plHrjHfTOvc,What’s the Goal song played by bufflao
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks like hell. That ref...c'mon
plHrjHfTOvc,EA SPORTS SUCK REMEMBER 2KSPORTS WELL EA BOUGHT THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY MAKING BETTER GAMES THEN EA SPORTS.... BOYCOTT EA
plHrjHfTOvc,"Played a lot Nhl 15, Played an massive amount Nhl 17, bought Nhl 18 and played half the season. Bought Nhl 19, played it one time. Feelt like i played this game before. New year same game..."
plHrjHfTOvc,Sooo lame EA.
plHrjHfTOvc,How do u get to play as a nhl team ?
plHrjHfTOvc,Mine doesnt even have updated rosters
plHrjHfTOvc,How do I do a match like this? When I try to play all I can do is online or chel
plHrjHfTOvc,"My goodness the goalies suck, hopefully this is rookie."
plHrjHfTOvc,how do you play offline ?
plHrjHfTOvc,Anybody want this on switch?
plHrjHfTOvc,I wonder if they can add PK to the game soon.
plHrjHfTOvc,The only positive from this game is Ray Ferraro. Everything else is a steaming hot pile of doodoo
plHrjHfTOvc,EA has to add in Crosby backhander signature shot
plHrjHfTOvc,"I last played this series in 2008.  I was a total failure at playing the game, but it was so much fun creating custom teams and players, and pinning them against one another.  Can that still be done?  And does anyone recommend a specific game in the series since then?"
plHrjHfTOvc,How do i get the beta??
plHrjHfTOvc,To be honest I miss mike emricks voice more than anything else.
plHrjHfTOvc,"If you put 19 in the title and removed the score bar from the bottom, I would've honestly believed it"
plHrjHfTOvc,The new intro is cool but idk how I feel about the new commentator or the scoreboard being on the bottom of the screen
plHrjHfTOvc,I can’t find it on mine
plHrjHfTOvc,Can you take accelerated clock off?
plHrjHfTOvc,All i have to say is the sabres better have there goat logo jerseys!!!
plHrjHfTOvc,where can we find the beta?? do i have to change my consoles location??
plHrjHfTOvc,I want to know if nhl still uses the ea ignite engine and if so would it be bad to use the frostbite engine?
plHrjHfTOvc,What do you play on PS4 or Xbox
plHrjHfTOvc,How the hell do we still not have goal horns for each team?? And in arena music every stadium has? I don't think I'm buying this year enough bs
plHrjHfTOvc,Bring Doc back this is insulting
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks exactly like nhl19
plHrjHfTOvc,who is this broadcaster?
plHrjHfTOvc,Thanks
plHrjHfTOvc,"Way too many penalties in the beta, something EA needs to fix"
plHrjHfTOvc,"I dont know man, I dont really like it at all. Is there a way to buy NHL 2006 with updated teams and smoother grafic? Would pay for it 60 like nothing."
plHrjHfTOvc,the commentary is amazing and i love the new graphics. the gameplay looks better to me
plHrjHfTOvc,"Commentary reminds me of the old nhl games when they didn’t have nbc, sounds way too acradeish. #bringnhl2kback"
plHrjHfTOvc,"Penalty box ghost opening for decades. Actually, don't understand all the hype about 20, it looks like 50 new animations and new hud. Player movement, puck pick-ups and goalies still look as dumb as fcku. By the way, you just got tripping penalty while reading this coment."
plHrjHfTOvc,Commentator blows
plHrjHfTOvc,Upstate NY in Buffalo?? When was that considered Upstate?
plHrjHfTOvc,QUESTION. Why the passing so slow in verses mode?
plHrjHfTOvc,Am I able to change the commentary back to Mike Emrick ??
plHrjHfTOvc,"Looks more fluid than the previous, not bad"
plHrjHfTOvc,Chalk this up along with madden as list of games I won’t waste money on
plHrjHfTOvc,Nothing new here and the play by play is awful!
plHrjHfTOvc,We were due for updated commentary and presentation
plHrjHfTOvc,is there only the one outside arena to play in for eashl drop in games on 2020
plHrjHfTOvc,I hate that angel noice when you score. Can you turn that off?
plHrjHfTOvc,Lets go Buffalo!! #Sabres
plHrjHfTOvc,"32:45, looks like nhl 94 on super nes"
plHrjHfTOvc,Un juegazo. Reservado. A partir de septiembre caña a los colegas con este pedazo de juegazo!
plHrjHfTOvc,Will they have a free demo on PS4
plHrjHfTOvc,JAMES CYBULSKI ?! LMAO OK. The nhl series has gotten worse ever since nhl 16
plHrjHfTOvc,The commentary is a lot more energetic than the last nhl games
plHrjHfTOvc,the gameplay to arcade like. its like playing the arcade 3's but 6's now
plHrjHfTOvc,I'm guessing a career in a european leaugue in 'be a pro' is still impossible. I'm also guessing they haven't added the possibility to represent your own country in the world championship. Will they ever?
plHrjHfTOvc,Do I need to pre order to get the beta?
plHrjHfTOvc,I miss doc
plHrjHfTOvc,Let’s goo devils
plHrjHfTOvc,Welp...so much for nbc
plHrjHfTOvc,I like nbc better
plHrjHfTOvc,That was not a charge.
plHrjHfTOvc,Oh man.. this commentary does not sound fun to listen too
plHrjHfTOvc,Lots of trippy
plHrjHfTOvc,"Glad I'm still playing NHL  14 and not whatever THIS (or 18 & 19 )is. Ea just needs to throw in the towel when it comes to sports games,let 2K take the reigns."
plHrjHfTOvc,NHL and Madden haven’t changed at all since ‘16. Waste of money.
plHrjHfTOvc,It’s western New York. Wtf
plHrjHfTOvc,b u f f a l o i s n o t u p s t a t e
plHrjHfTOvc,How do play offline in beta?
plHrjHfTOvc,This looks like the exact same game with a new scoreboard and commentators. Pass.
plHrjHfTOvc,wtf the is the score borad on the bottom for is there a option u can pit it to the top
plHrjHfTOvc,Love Hockey … but Yeah but … this  commentary seems to get worse n worse… annoying … don‘t see that much/anything has changed gameplaywise either! Stupid Penaltys - the D is still a jeapardy
plHrjHfTOvc,"The commentary was a big selling point for this years iteration. Yet it is even more disappointing than the Doc, even though it never annoyed me all that much. Please return Jim Hughes, Gary Thorn or perhaps Gord Miller or Darren Dreger.  The latter two would be my preffered options."
plHrjHfTOvc,Is the beta only for online gameplay
plHrjHfTOvc,"The ea devs continue to preach their place is to small compared to the maddens fifas etc of the world and I agree. HOWEVER they continue to recycle, takeaway and not improve. Ie see first edition to new system."
plHrjHfTOvc,Think i might stick to NHL 2K10 lol
plHrjHfTOvc,how i get it
plHrjHfTOvc,So y'all still haven't changed this game? Pathetic.
plHrjHfTOvc,John Forslund would have been a better commentator
plHrjHfTOvc,The fact that this is a major game and they still can’t get it right that Buffalo isn’t upstate New York
plHrjHfTOvc,"What's the deal with EA not being able to get the scene transitions to be nice and smooth...any time there's a reply, the action freezes for that split second and then the EA logo comes up and takes you back to the action. I know its not a super huge deal but that slight pause/freeze just ruins the immersion a bit."
plHrjHfTOvc,"Jeez, the announcer is trying wayyyyy to hard, at this rate he'll be in the next XXL Freshman cypher. This is the same company that can get Martin Tyler"
plHrjHfTOvc,", Alan Smith, Derek Rae, AND Lee Dixon for FIFA 19, why can't they pay for just one decent set of commentators for CHEL?"
plHrjHfTOvc,This commentator is great
plHrjHfTOvc,"It amazes me how much people bitch about this awesome video hockey game.The gameplay, the most important thing, is outstanding! I’m a working adult though so maybe that’s why I appreciate the game."
plHrjHfTOvc,"I HATE the ugly arcade looking ""GOAL"" graphic text...."
plHrjHfTOvc,"Honestly, doesn't look that great. Looks only marginally better than it did in 2005. What makes paying $80 for this every year worth it?"
plHrjHfTOvc,How do you playa quick game
plHrjHfTOvc,Watch Game Informer play a full hockey game without commentary showing off the new features for EA's NHL 20. Can someone tell me what are those new features they showed us? I cant seem to find them in a video.
plHrjHfTOvc,"I understand everyone's frustration with the game feeling the same for the last 5 years or so, but it looks like the best version yet. Until next gen or VR is released you won't see a huge difference. "
plHrjHfTOvc,Love this but prefer for Fox Sports announcer
plHrjHfTOvc,Is the beta available? On ps4
plHrjHfTOvc,FINALLY a new presentation and commentary. For gods sake I know hockey isn’t the #1 sport but they lost NBA to 2K and hockey has such a great cult following that I hope this 1 got the attention it deserves! Especially for a milestone year! I’ve been jamming this game ever since Sega Genesis but have felt let down the last few years
plHrjHfTOvc,Game looks awful
plHrjHfTOvc,Why I can’t have jack hughes
plHrjHfTOvc,Buffaloooooo
plHrjHfTOvc,They Are just not the same anymore I want nhl 11 announcers and the gameplay just seems whack
plHrjHfTOvc,Save your money folkes. Playing in a puddle would be more fun then  this recycled garbage every year.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Same boring game, year after year."
plHrjHfTOvc,i dont like the replays
plHrjHfTOvc,"Still herky-jerky movement and no inertia carrying the players around. Increasing your character animations and their blending is great, but a more dynamic response (with middleware like Euphoria, or the grounded ""weight"" of people like in RDR2) is critical in sports games."
plHrjHfTOvc,all hope is lost
plHrjHfTOvc,"Im on a 4 year streak of not buying EA's version of hockey. Guess this is going to be the 5th.. Come on EA, this sucks so bad!!!"
plHrjHfTOvc,Hughes playing center is a real bruh moment.
plHrjHfTOvc,Comment qu'on fait pour lavoir
plHrjHfTOvc,Who’s the commentator in this ?
plHrjHfTOvc,"Not a huge fan of this announcer, but at least it’s all different. Might buy this one, last game I have is 18."
plHrjHfTOvc,Game looks fake graphics suck?
plHrjHfTOvc,I feel like they should have just used the Blues and Bruins....
plHrjHfTOvc,Where is it for the PS4 users
plHrjHfTOvc,"Wow, it doesn't just show the arena after every whistle, this time?"
plHrjHfTOvc,Who’s pee pee did you suck to get the beta before all of us ?
plHrjHfTOvc,Who is this commentator? Where’s doc?
plHrjHfTOvc,"Commentary doesn't seem to sound like a 2 man team , sounds like ray Ferraro is a younger brother just trying to get a word in lol"
plHrjHfTOvc,The game looks much more smooth
plHrjHfTOvc,"If your like me and love offline modes, this is a great game by the looks and thank god they fixed the commentary"
plHrjHfTOvc,Nice game
plHrjHfTOvc,"Im sorry the play by play commentary is not good, nbc did need to be changed but the play by play guy is always yelling. When its like that id rather have nbc"
plHrjHfTOvc,"Good to see EA Sports has done nothing about the passing mechanics that are still as broken as whoever designed the scoreboard, and I love how they improved the a.i puck intelligence, notice how players can be directly near the puck and not even attempt to grab it, and what’s really impressive is when they do attempt to grab the puck and they have to keep attempting because the mechanics in the game are the last thing EA wants to focus on, why would they focus on mechanics when they can focus on a better ultimate team feature that is paid to win, and doesn’t even mean anything after 12 months cause there’s going to be another installment anyways ???? in conclusion, "
plHrjHfTOvc,I wish these clowns would learn geography it is not upstate ny it is western ny. Hard to catch the puck with these giant gloves? Can you make the clock actually real time?
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks just like nhl 19
plHrjHfTOvc,"Whoever is playing the game, needs to get their NHL game up... yikes! At least I didn’t hear a repeated line from the commentary once throughout the game. Also I didn’t even see a single deke I don’t think the whole game lol. Are y’all playing with the NHL 94 controls or what??"
plHrjHfTOvc,"Finally they got rid of Emerick. American broadcasters are terrible, but they should have brought back Hughson."
plHrjHfTOvc,"The game feels better than 19, and even though this beta has bugs and issues they are still improving. They even went out and made a full list of things that they fixed between the beta and the full realease "
plHrjHfTOvc,"Finding actual people who can play would be nice. Hire me, I play competitively and have a university degree @gameinformer, this guy is booty ?. These guys aren’t even showing off the gameplay properly, they have no hockey IQ and no idea who the game works. It’s almost as if you just gave 2 random people controllers. We wanna see how L2 reacts in this game, how effective the dekes are, different shot variations. All I’m seeing is one timers, cross crease passes, and random shots from way out. Test rebound control, and move advanced shots."
plHrjHfTOvc,I im happy ray back my favorite one
plHrjHfTOvc,Corny
plHrjHfTOvc,"For everyone who’s dissing the beta for not looking like a real hockey game, it’s because on here it’s broadcasted on EA and not NBC. Another part of why they changed up the commentary, Doc and Eddie commentate on NBC, not EA. Love the new announcer, makes the game sound more epic in itself. Scoreboard does fuck w/ my mind however but I’ll just get used to it"
plHrjHfTOvc,This ain’t beta this is the real game
plHrjHfTOvc,I didn’t think it was possible for the commentary to get worse... yikes.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Same as 19, there is no point buying"
plHrjHfTOvc,only way to get a new nhl game is to stop buying them.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Hello, I am a kid who loves ice hockey in Korea.My favorite game series is the NHL series from EA SPORTS.As you know, NHL20 OPEN BETA is here.I've been looking everywhere for low-cost downloads, but I'm not sure how to download them.I'm a PS4 user.If you know, please tell us in the comments.I ask a favor of you."
plHrjHfTOvc,This is not the beta
plHrjHfTOvc,They should’ve kept the nhl 19 broadcasts scoreboard.
plHrjHfTOvc,I hate the new commentator
plHrjHfTOvc,"Definitely buying this, looks way better than 19, commentary is better and I really hate the people saying how trash this game is"
plHrjHfTOvc,Nice to know that tripping hasn’t been fixed yet .
plHrjHfTOvc,"The commentary sounds hillarious tho annoying. He is so nasal  (high pich) with his voice. Reminds me of when jim hughson was in the game tho. That was awesome. ""Chara FLATTENS Larionov!"" ""THATS ROBBERY!"""
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks like the game breaking tripping penalties are making a return.  Haven't bought an NHL game since 16. Wont be buying
plHrjHfTOvc,? ???? ?????? ??? ?? ??
plHrjHfTOvc,Question. Can anyone please tell me if Team USA has officially licensed jerseys in NHL 20? Are they still using generic flag jerseys? I noticed that Canada finally got licensed jerseys in NHL 19. Was hoping USA would finally have authentic ones.
plHrjHfTOvc,I hate the Commentary and the Scoreboard
plHrjHfTOvc,Cant wait for the ps5 theese graphic feels like 2006.
plHrjHfTOvc,Announcer sounds like he belongs on  Blades of steel
plHrjHfTOvc,Very cartoonish
plHrjHfTOvc,Looks like a great game...The new scoreboard should be on the upper left or right corner...The new announcers are a fresh change that was needed badly...Two things that would make this game much more enjoyable though would be custom roster sharing and custom music into the game...I was watching a clip of nhl 20 and noticed during a stoppage of play a song they had in another NHL game a few years back...unacceptable to recycle the same music in game...Custom music would be awesome in these games again.
plHrjHfTOvc,"The commentary is improved, still missing some action in between lines. I still don’t like that names of players are used infrequently."
plHrjHfTOvc,"Gameplay wise the penalties occur to often to me & the animations still need work... I’m still seeing animations for things from NHL 15 in this, just not enough variety... but this seems like a better effort than Madden 20, and if the skate physics are improved like they did in NHL 19 this looks worth a buy."
plHrjHfTOvc,How many likes this get is how many penalties he got
plHrjHfTOvc,The commentary is actually awesome compared to games passed. A lot less generic responses
plHrjHfTOvc,I hate that scoreboard
plHrjHfTOvc,Never deleted a game so quickly.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Turn your ice trainer off, n00b."
plHrjHfTOvc,Paul romanuk better than this announcer.  And thats means you are really bad
plHrjHfTOvc,Ahh the commentary actually sounds decent for now
plHrjHfTOvc,Scoreboard sucks but the rest is perfect
plHrjHfTOvc,"Say what you want,  but the more I watch the beta, the more I can't wait to play. I love the graphics presentation,  the scoreboard at the bottom doesn't bother me. The graphics for goals and penalties are nice, even if it seems arcade style. I'm glad they dropped NBC."
plHrjHfTOvc,That one announcer sucks
plHrjHfTOvc,Jesus christ the commentator is horrendous.
plHrjHfTOvc,"Crappy hard animations, nothing look faker than that, why don't they go with realistic ragdolls? and why players never lose their stick or helmet or gloves? removing all features for these dumb animations I see..."
plHrjHfTOvc,Crap. They will never fix hockey.
plHrjHfTOvc,"The commentary is phenomenal holy shit gameplay looks fun, graphics look decent, can’t wait to play tonight"
plHrjHfTOvc,"Trash... Same glitches with the ref sequences... No audible calls by the refs... And other than a few improved player representations... All the same. Will not buy another NHL game until they can move the shit to the frostbite engine, and give me a more authentic experience. Better hit animations, more speed, better physics, better overall game presentation, better fight animations.... Fuck it... Can we get our one decent game so we can bitch about IT for the next 10 years you won't change shit?"
plHrjHfTOvc,I would win both of the players 15-0. For real xD
plHrjHfTOvc,"it looks smoother. Updating the graphics I can see. New commentators, new presentation package, better goalies. Everything looks quite refreshing. I’m very happy to see that. I think the goals looks much better, really beauty goals. Looks very nice."
plHrjHfTOvc,How stupid how here we go now isn’t the goal song here like not every team their authentic goal song here
plHrjHfTOvc,not wasting money on this its so fake not even funny
plHrjHfTOvc,"So, no more NBC affiliation?"
plHrjHfTOvc,You nhl ppl need to stop crying about anything if u play madden your still mad since 2005
plHrjHfTOvc,Anyone know how to get the beta
plHrjHfTOvc,that stupid score board ??
plHrjHfTOvc,Game sucks looks fake
plHrjHfTOvc,Ea sucks
plHrjHfTOvc,It boggles my mind how much people are being cry babies about this game the commentary is way way wayyyyyyyyy more exciting and the new broadcast overlays give it a fresh look. Free tampons fro the cry babies
plHrjHfTOvc,EA is garbage
plHrjHfTOvc,This announcers trash
plHrjHfTOvc,Commentary is complete trash. NHL is a garbage game
plHrjHfTOvc,Game sucks. Nothing new. Change the Fing faceoff cameras already. Still not substitutions on face offs. The game looks worse every year. To cartoonish. The skaters are not fluid. Impossible to setup plays. I bet there are no penalties call hence no power plays.Why can't we set our own camera angles.  .Its best if EA loses the license and let 2k take the chance again. Disappointing!
plHrjHfTOvc,"This game sucks stats are way off , to much enthusiasm by commentary for regular season game , to many goals scored every game I. Franchise mode it’s 7-3 8-4 9-3 crazy , penalties are unrealistic if you lower them to 4 or 5 they dot. Call  any penalties .. 19 had better control of the puck in the zone keeping the puck in and setting up offense , it seems opponent come down the ice just shooting all over the place .. no dumping no working the boards"
plHrjHfTOvc,This game feels a lot more fast paced than the last games..almost arcade like and it is not bad at all
plHrjHfTOvc,Good god that commentary is horrible.
plHrjHfTOvc,Commentary is horrible why does every play sound like ot game 7 finals
plHrjHfTOvc,I don't hate the commentary
plHrjHfTOvc,this game is horrible not wasting money for a fake ass Hockey game with fake Commentary and a Scoreboard this company has no idea how to make a real hocket game I stopped playing NHL since 16 miss Don and Eddie this guy has no idea about hockey
plHrjHfTOvc,It sucks. Team ratings are off. The clock is distracting being the on the bottom. The annoucer may be the only improvement.

iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I feel like ""a plagues tale"" is forgotten already"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn...Astral Chain really got shafted this year. You wouldn't be faulted for not even knowing the game exists based on 90% of the gaming outlets.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Are ""The Outer Wilds"" and ""The Outer worlds"" Diffrent games made by diffrent developers??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Awww. No Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers. I guess since it’s an expansion it doesn’t really fit into a bunch of categories.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,07:24:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: THE LAST OF US! 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Video: Animal Crossing...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When they said apex was good I was screaming in my head just play fu* king Titanfall it has the same controls plus double jump and wall running
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake: multiplayer games make all the money
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jedi fallen order: hold my lightsaber
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m scared Jake is going to walk out of my shower while I’m brushing my teeth and announce the best underwater game of the year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love how Jake just starts eating pizza mid-video ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,everyone else: films themselves for their segment
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon: just voice over pictures of a falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Come on Falcon, I was expecting a talking falcon in your segment :P"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"7:40 - I seriously thought this was gonna be a Falcon reveal, wtf!!!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Falcon? Most anticipated game for 2020 and no... uh.. The Last of Us Part 2? Huh?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Falcon? Most anticipated game for 2020 and no... uh.. The Last of Us Part 2? Huh?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ghosts of Tsushima not in anticipated games huh...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"How come when they go ""off script"" or forget something it still feels scripted?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"This video was uploaded 4 days ago, but I was just notified about it. Did this happen to anybody else?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hollow Knight : Silksong should’ve been among anticipated picks
iRxJg2y2UqQ,did you just recommend a walking simulater game lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I can't believe that a game of a goose bothering people ended up being a masterpiece
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex legends has literally taken over my multiplayer life.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That What just happened at the end made me laugh so hard that my dad ran into my room and asked if everythibg is ok?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,3:45 OMFG those shoes with that outfit?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Flush yourself queen.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Whos here sitting barely played a fraction of these games feeling dumb.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,if so drop a like
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Jake baldino catch phrases
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Let’s get right into it”
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Take this with a grain of salt”
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“This has been a great year for video game” 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I lost it when jake was holding freedom fighters ??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mw for best multiplayer? Those who voted for that: certified speds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Tom with the Travis Scott’s is pretty cool
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It makes me really sad that metro Exodus didn't get any awards that game was fantastic and should've had been shown more love
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Andrew wasn't asleep he inhaled to much mold from the power armor helmet and lost consciousness
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""what's up geeks and gamers!"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The outer worlds is just amazing.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How does Kingdom Hearts 3 get nominated for best RPG and also most disappointing game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The division 2 should definitely have been up there for best graphics. The world is so immersive and detailed!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Guy: how are we going to annonce the game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Other guy: I don’t but it’s noon and I’m hungry for some pizza
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Guy: Yes!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Falcon: “Hey guys, Its Falcon” "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: YEAHHHHHHHH
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:31 was the best part of the video I laughed when Jake fell off his chair
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My most anticipated game for 2020: 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last Of Us 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m starting to think at gameranx they don’t like Monster Hunter World lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Dude had to cross his legs to flex em jays ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Also, only Gameranx video where falcon doesn’t say “I’m gonna go ahead and say”"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow. Historic moment
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How come I never see rust in these type of videos anyone else ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Borderlands 3 is GOTY for me. I was so hyped, and was not let down."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Playing through Control, currently. Glad you guys are giving it so much love"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Anyone else love how professionally unprofessional this video was
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"1:20 I love how the talk starts with him and 3 empty sources of caffeine on his desk, lol."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Pls do one for the entire decade
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Edit: the top part of my inbox is just replies to this comment lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This video for sure got my bell notification just from the intro
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Sad to see Sekiro, days gone and the outer worlds not getting enough love ? I consider them to be some of my favourite games of all time!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"1:32 voice over. Ah, good. They DO have adult supervision. Do more, Falcon!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,7:38 me outside my crushes house
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You just know falcon was trying so hard to hold back when he said anthem?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"So, Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers didn't warrant a nomination for multiplayer, RPG, narrative, or sound track?  Shame on you, gameranx!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"why would links awakening et game of the year, it's a remake."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This video just solidified my love for you guys.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’ve discovered gaming pretty late in life and the first one I got was Fallen Order. I feel the bar has been set seriously high!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,10/10 best location transitions and bonus points for the ghillie suit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Song name for when the “best graphics” segment came up?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""EA didn't ruin"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"except for that little controversy revolving around, what buying nearly 170 dollars of loot boxes just to unlock the ability to buy a relic?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shout out to the guy at the end in the Travis Scott Jordan 1s lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Star Wars music is always very iconic so I think it should’ve been in TV e best music topic and this is my opinion I don’t know about you
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"While your picks are wildly different from mine, i just had to drop a like for this format, hope you didn't catch something in that dumpster"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer worlds wasn't even nominated for best score????? This is an outrage.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,07:24:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: THE LAST OF US! 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Anyone else love how professionally unprofessional this video was
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most Disappointing Game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I really like the dude with the hat. He’s awesome. So are you Jake. And falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Were here in this abandoned mall"" "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Wait, why?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I thought breakpoint was actually very good and enjoyable. Guess it was just me ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This year most dissapointing game : Warcraft 3 Reforged
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That was the most wasted two minutes of my life
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"AHAHAHAHAH, BEST SHOW EVER! XD"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I'm surprised The Last of Us Part II wasn't in the Most Anticipated category but it's all good, great video"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,14:08 I want remake/reboot of this game or at least release on steam or GOG.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Talks about he he over uses phrases, then immediately uses Philip DeFranco’s catchphrase."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kingdom hearts 3 nominated for best RPG and most disappointing game...OK sure why not
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Are you holding freedom fighter at 14:17? I use to love that game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I Love Gameranx. Been subbed for years.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys need to add a sports gamer to your team, the only time you talk about sports games are fifa"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,sad time when a mediocre rpg like the outer worlds is getting game of year talk
iRxJg2y2UqQ,01:34:00 PM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ya'll clearly haven't played Noita
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love that your GOTY vids always feel like a high school group project  thrown together. It’s charming and fun. Great year guys!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m not sure if I’ll ever differentiate between The Outer Worlds and The Outer Wilds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,7/10 on the landing at the end
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thank you for giving days gone some love it’s my personal goty which is divisive to say but people are acting like it doesn’t exist this year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake really do be growing a neck-beard tho
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Someone should recreate all the old games we used to play on websites for mobile.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Can’t wait for 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 is going to be one of the best games ever!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,where’s child eating simulator
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Would you think that legend of Zelda breath of the wild was an RPG? We'll in my opinion that game was phenomenal in many ways, the world was very big to hyrule castle to the vast desert then there is the fighting which I loved. You could party the enemy's attacks to get an upper hand along with dodging."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,this was the most phoned-in video I've ever seen from you guys.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I love these guys! Totally agree with everything that have been said here, with all the scores/marks and rankings."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I can't believe 2019 is already over, it felt like the year just began."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Kingdom Hearts 3 was my favourite release from the whole year, FF7 is my most anticipated"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Half-Life: Akyx didn't even make the most anticipated for 2020 as a NOMINEE?? Y'all suck
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lmfao perfect ending to a great year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Just started the video. Metro Exodus better be on this list. It’s been snubbed too many times.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,But did Jake really need to be in that trashcan lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,See you all in 40 years from now this gonna be nostalgic video
iRxJg2y2UqQ,jake you finally got your hair perfect! (from the 2019 intro that it :P)  shout out to the awesome gilly suit into for open world games that was awesome :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hold up
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did this man just make a HOTDOG HOODIE?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Genius
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:47 first time a heard anyone from gameranx cuss
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Dude seriously when we gonna get a falcon face reveal ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,funniest game awards yet xD
iRxJg2y2UqQ,also... so glad to see the yoda back!! I miss him from the old Friday show backround :D
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Wow, I didn't know only 5 games released this year."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Really surprised that Disco Elysium didn’t even get nominated for best narrative.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,07:24:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: THE LAST OF US! 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The division nominated is enough, actually surprised it even got picked with all the hate it gets. Niceee"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake is literally a living meme and I love it!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You should make another vid like this but with all the games of the decade since the decade is closing up.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Im happy that you guys selected Days Gone as best open world game of 2019 ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex Legends is easily the best multiplayer/battle royale of the year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,He looks exactly how he sounds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My favorite point was when he followed up discussing Ghost Recon: Breakpoint with informing us that he discovered a little rat in the dumpster he was standing in.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You should also do a Best Games of the Decade list.  I imagine that will be a very tough list to make.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Great video, lots of fun to see all of the picks. I would throw Luigi's Mansion 3 and Yoshi's Crafted World up into best style as well."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm looking forward to Doom Eternal too...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jedi: Fallen Order was fantastic!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I got Star Wars just last week and its damn amazing. Great game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love the commitment to the cause
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"hey Jake, is this the sunrise mall in Holbrook new york! I saw the clip infornt of toys are us, I have been going there my entire life!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Great one, thx guys for your hard work and amazing content."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I personally don’t see why Kingdom hearts 3 was on the most disappointing list tbh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Falcon? Most anticipated game for 2020 and no... uh.. The Last of Us Part 2? Huh?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Best Disappointing Game"" as a category had me cracking up lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My mans tom rocking the Travis Scott 1’s ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex Legends since they brought that new map its been trash tbh the old map was waaaaaaay better
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"@Gameranx - Did yall seriously not give out a console the week of Christmas?  I never win anyways, but all the same someone would have been happy to get one I'm sure."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Doom over cyberpunk for most anticipated? Bethesda vs CD Projekt? is there any competition?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I like the effort that went into making this video it is clearly apparent in all of the different and fun locations that were chosen for filming. This is what separates your channel from something bland and monotone like Watchmojo, It is passion that drives you not to push out as much videos as possible. "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This video should be 3 seconds long.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I agree I love the last Ghost Recon and I really tried my hardest to get into the breakpoint game but I just could not
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ok hold on how is outward not one of the best indie games?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Remnant from the ashes is one of the best games I played in recent years. Not even mentioned though.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"love the part where Jake was on a dumpster and says disappointing games of 2019 ,awesome."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,lol DOOM Eternal. I have loved your channel for years but this just made me unsubscribe.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Doom eternal, lmao."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Star Wars Fallen Order was just an amazing experience. The best star wars story we've gotten since star wars the clone wars!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,PLEASE TELL ME WHERE TO GET THAT PIZZA! IT LOOKS AMAZING!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Seeing jake in a Guilee makes me so happy
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“They don’t even have security”
iRxJg2y2UqQ,God I laughed so damn hard and I don’t know why.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"apparently, only 6 games were released this year and somehow got nominated in each category."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Dang, that's pizza looks so good"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,6:13: Why the ? swallowing? WHY?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Guys. I absolutely love this video. You’ve put a lot of work into it, and obviously had a lot of fun making it. "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Been following Gameranx for years now and I really like the sense of community that this channel has. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"currently playing Control, yeah it's amazing but the story looks kinda weak so far, I wouldn't say it's goty just for the weird script and not believable characters"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly it feels like starwars is being given praise for doing the bare minimum good.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I stopped watching when you didn't include the last of us 2 as anticipated.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I was waiting for division 2 to win votes. Then i remembered how broken the game is, worse then division 1 ever was.."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hey folks today is Friday 2019 you totally forget to say that!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Most anticipated game of 2020"" doesn't even make The Last of Us part II as a nominee.  ????????????????"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,1:06 hey thats killing floor
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised you didn't include Astral Chain neither on the list of the best music score nor the best style.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys are mean.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"wow, can't believe we finally get an actual face reveal for falcon 6:57"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Everyone was high on crack filming this,I swear"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 is so underrated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The outer worlds is amazing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What camera did y'all use to shoot this footage? Great content BTW!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shoutout to you guys for the hard work but I dislike most of the list
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys should do a category called ""best combat"" for games that have new and innovative combat"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When will we get Falcon face reveal D:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Three houses is my goty 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm so excited for dying light 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,anthem: goty edition
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm so glad you decided to present both public and your own opinion. I feel all outlets should have that.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My favorite 2019 game was Days Gone, it was really really fun to play, and i loved the story"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,17:19 So these are the people who i always let decide what game i buy
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jeeeez, you're all so stoned in the studio ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When I heard call of duty modern warfare I couldn't stop laughing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And the winner is... “Fallout 76!”
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I've been with u guys from year 1 way back in da days, please never let falcon reveal himself"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Now I finally know everyone in the studio
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"that fallout helmet is literally poisonous, Bethesda took them back at some point of time"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Been having a blast playing battlefront 2 after watching your recent vid
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Best game experience I had this year was Outer Wilds. It just clicked with me so much. Surprised me many times and getting clues and getting the whole story of the game through exploration. Music was dope, recommend listening to devs podcast where they talk about the production of the music. Thanks for all the news and your hard work jake, tom, andrew and falcon. 2020.... damn this ia weird..."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Hey, Jake. Thanks for the pizza! Very cool!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is the economy dying where you live lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Great video. Amazing locations. What production values!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"That was really weird how they had a best music of the year in a game category yet they didn’t even play one snipet of music from them as an example, that was very wack and surprising from the pros of cool videos about video games at Gamerax, that’s like taking about best graphics of the year and not even showing video or at least a damn picture!!!  Lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is there no ‘best racing game of 2019’ award?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Last year was one of the best games of the year if that makes sense
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"if you are gonna include ""call of duty"" who release a re-skin game yearly than why NOT include warframe in it place."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"It would be nice to have a strategy list for the year, just an suggestion"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,These guys are so East Coast it hurts.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Every other video - Nominee: Devil May Cry 5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best Style - Nominee: No Devil May Cry 5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The opportunity for a star wars reference was ripe in that dumpster.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I love these guys’ videos but I hate that JRPGs is so niche, one day they’ll have a section in these yearly wrap up video. "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Holding out hope
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Are you eating soup?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The settings were fun.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,no one:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake: casually dresses up as a hotdog
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That cloth tearing ASMR though.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think you should record these in one place. It gives the video a more professional look.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn Metro Exodus isn't getting any love. what a shame!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,13:51 is this falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,GTFOH! HOW FFVII REMAKE DIDN'T WIN BEST UPCOMING GAME? ??? That will be the best game of the next decade... Forget the year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Great job. A lot of work have been put in this video, and it shows."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,looking for a game that his a lot of stuff to to do you now one that has a lot to do
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Game of the year, Battlefield 5!   Hahaha just kidding."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My little girl couldn't stop laughing at Jake tearing off his costume and falling off the chair, thank you for making a 5 year old crack up lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Great games selected forthe best ones in 2019 -- TOP -- I would add ""Disco Elysium"" as innovative and fresh RPG"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,There’s probably a good reason for not including The Last Of Us Pt. 2 for most anticipated game but it should be an honorable mention
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thank you for posting!   Gave me some new ideas.  I subscribe to Xbox magazine just to get ideas ever since the Morgan Webb on X-Play went offline.  Nice to see someone doing video games reviews and awards to let us know what else is out there.   Now to get Morgan to do a guest spot in 2020? :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This reminds me of '90s MTV
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers had a wonderful soundtrack, wish there was a little bit more MMO love in the list. But other than that loved the list and the community and Gameranx choices."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shadowkeep is the number one game this year. Hands down.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How are they gonna do most anticipates game of 2020 and not include dying light 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Ok, technically yes RE2 does have some action and some adventure, but I feel like you guys should definitely know that it's survival/horror way more than it is action/adventure. Also, I kind of feel like any set of choices that involve Apex Legends should have Apex more or less win by default, because unlike literally everything it's competing against the game is essentially free."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"This is borderline ""adult swim"" material."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Star wars, call of duty... nice 12 yo audience you have lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon needs a face reveal your my favorite co host from this show bro
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Well, that was weird."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i hope andrew didnt get the moldy version of the fallout helmet
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What just happened at the “best open world” announcement? Lmao ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I enjoyed Control. Love the supernatural story and mystery behind it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake my dude. Get in shape. Did u run out of breath climbing the tree or jumping out of it. Lmao.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I absolutely loved Days Gone! Great story and gameplay.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"kinda disappointed on the game choices, so many good games out there and these  5 textbook answers made the list of every category zzz. no sub"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yooo I live right next to the sun vet mall hahaha I’m surprised anyone knows about that!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,PS I’m a big fan
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Well after watching this vid I think I’ll play control lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The best 'game of the year' you tube video out there thanks
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This is why i love Gameranx. Thanks guys :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Dayz Gone needs so much more love. First list I've seen that includes it, that's why I like gameranx."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I was surprised last of us part 2 wasn’t in the most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I see those Travis Scott Jordan 1’s
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel as if the last of us part two should have been on the most anticipated game of 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I wish Apsulov would've made it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Congrats on picking Days Gone as best open world game!  I can't figure out why it's not more highly rated!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Are you eating soup?"" How dare you!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Best graphics, where's forza horizon 4??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Really surprised that Disco Elysium didn’t even get nominated for best narrative.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best Mobile Game: 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I have looked on android and Apple store I cannot for the life of me find this game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,im confused on how Detroit: Become Human wasnt on any of these lists...i feel it is a great and solid game and should have at least made it on 1 of these lists if not a few
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is the Shadowbringers? One of the best MMORPG expansion in this decade...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I havent even seen most of the games shown in this video . . .
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I still read it as gamer anx everytime and it's applicable.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And I feel borderlands 3 looked quite pretty you know it was well done
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The ending when Jake came out of the Hotdog and fell was hilarious ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"title should be ""we picked 10 or so games and only chose from them in each category"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i like the top mobile category but most of these lists are just repeating and just make the video seem like the crunchy roll awards lending out awards to mha
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Are you eating pizza..hah reminds me of some dood that sponsored and hosted a fighting game evo or esl or whatever event and everytime itd cut to commercial and come back hed be eating a sandwich for some reason ha like we all want to see this dood eat..its great
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is the last of us not the most anticipated?? it’s not even on the list to choose from !!!! mind blown!!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm just happy that RAID was never mentioned.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,honestly my game of the year for me was Void Bastards a awesome indie rougelike FPS made by some of the System Shock and Bioshock dev team <3
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was days gone in action adventure
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think this video was just a subtle message from Jake that he wants to get out of the office more.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jedi fallen order is a good game, they follow Dark Souls / Sekiro style of game."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"But the in game items are just skins, so collecting the loots feel pointless for me, and just straight out doing main story only."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake in the ghillie suit... priceless
iRxJg2y2UqQ,you forgot about the last of part 2 in most anticipated game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Luigis mansion 3 didint even get a mention
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Everyone is so High in this
iRxJg2y2UqQ,are we just going to ignore the travis scott jordan ones he has
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Whenever I hear about any award for best soundtrack~
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My mind : NIER AUTOMATA
iRxJg2y2UqQ,even though it's from 2k17
iRxJg2y2UqQ,For those who want to skip to game of the year 12:01 :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,00:00 Our boi is cringe-consciousness.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Liking just for resident evil 2 <3
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When is GTA VI coming out?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I'm surprised Disco Elysium wasn't even nominated for the style category,"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Yup, Control was my favorite of the year.From the cool and sophisticated  storyline (you can tell they are Kojima fans), the cool building level(levels) and one of the most satisfactory game mechanics of the year.The destructive powers of The Director feel amazing to play, specially the telekinesis!It’s just so satisfactory to bash enemies and destroy everything around you.For me it’s the best representation of super powers in a video game, even tough it’s not a super hero video game per se.And lastly it’s a new IP, and highly quality new ips are always an welcomed change in the industry."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This just makes me sad because I realized I haven’t played any of these games because I’ve been too busy to get into any game for the past year or two
iRxJg2y2UqQ,hmmm looking like youtube rewind 2019 watch mojo
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love how when they were in the “woods” you can see cars drive by I love these guys
iRxJg2y2UqQ,17:19 my brain cells at 3 am
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Nah, I want to hear Falcon say What’s up gamers"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best single player game of the year...?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I never heard of any of those mobile games, I would've nominated E7"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best game award show ever in The Woods
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Let's just jump right into it"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Careful Jake.. Phillip De Franco might see that XD
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How would you care more about doom than cyberpunk?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control finnally getting the regonition it deserves. :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,is that Sun Vet Mall ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Surprised you didn't have Last of Us 2 in anticipated, I feel like there were alot of other games I can't quite recall at the moment. Anyways, love the quirkiness you guys put in your videos, never get too professional :)"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think dying light 2 is also a big anticipated game to be honest. I know it wasn’t nominated or anything but it still deserves the attention. I agree with the other picks tho
iRxJg2y2UqQ,DUDE I honestly thought Anthem came out last year because the backlash felt so long ago lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn need for speed heat needed some love
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait where was last of two for most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"commenting just to appreciate our bois at gameranx, you guys did really well this year and I just want to thank you guys for your hard work this year"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,04:00:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Raid shadow legends has left the chat
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not even a single mention of Patholgic 2!!! Wow. I think this game needs more attention.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"A real gamer channel WOW, Thank you."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,brothers how did we come to this forgetting the sacred one minecraft i am dissapointed
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best worst game award goes to...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ps you guys should have had a best dlc category. I think good dlcs get overlooked because 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,they get a bad rep but i'd def be down for best dlc showcase!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""what just happened?"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My best games of 2019 are Remnant which came out of nowhere and Star Wars, surprised EA didn’t destroy it."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"So the community chose the literal ripoff of sekiro instead of sekiro? damn, that's tough"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I was a bit worried about playing control but if you guys vouch for how good it is I think I will give it a try, thanks lads ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think borderlands 3 has the best style. Just my opinion :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best gaming channel in youtube
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Greetings from Chile ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Im so glad Devil May Cry 5 won almost every category. Definitely game of the year.

iRxJg2y2UqQ,AC odyssey kinda great! Wonder why it doesnt make it to the nominees
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Mens, for best musical score, My Friend Pedro should have definitely made the cut."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control is so good I feel like it was overlooked
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow last of us 2. Dying light 2 weren't even mentioned
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro....deserves more recognition from this channels viewers and the channel creators .
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How can Doom Eternal be more anticipated than Cyberpunk lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Kinda wish you had used more scenes when you read the nominations, as much as I love seeing Higgs over and over again, maybe something that would pertain more to the award at hand? Also seeing Dante dart around for the third or fourth time does get old."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You should do 'the best character creation game'
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"hey can u guys do a ""what we want from the new mass effect game"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was HL: Alyx for most anticipated game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Question : Why do we never see falcon's face?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Jeremies send their regards
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Favourite gaming news YouTube channel! Love you guys!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The amount of times I heard ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"" in the background of watching this video is insane"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,bit suprised last of us part 2 wasnt in the most anticipated list
iRxJg2y2UqQ,4:51 Is that Falcon?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"We all know who Falcon is, why does he keep hiding his face?! ??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Why is it that i've never played any of these games before. Also, no VR category? hmm."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where are all my star wars fans who picked Jedi Fallen order when ever it came up as an option?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Great Video. Have you checked out  Crossout it is in my mind really Awesome to play?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jake falling was pure gold lol. Love you guys. Gameranx is ""da best"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 is my favorite game of the year and breakpoint was my biggest let down
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I cant believe they diudnt add the last of us part 2 for 2020 games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Playing through Control, currently. Glad you guys are giving it so much love"

iRxJg2y2UqQ,U guys made a splendid video?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You forgot best racing game. I'm sad. You owe me $20.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro was unequivocally game of the year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sad that DMC didn’t get any awards :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best rpg for me was kingdom hearts 3

iRxJg2y2UqQ,"That's the tastiest looking pizza, I have ever seen"

iRxJg2y2UqQ,I do like Worlds Edge too though
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"wheres boneworks on this list, hmm"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did you just miss last of us 2 for being a nominee for most anticipated game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Man, it seems like y’all only played 20 games this year"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,THE LAST OF US 2 ISNT EVEN ON THE MOST ANTICIPATED... shook lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Please do this every year. Incredible??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best music is Kingdom Hearts 3 and why is it an the most disapointing list?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fallen order was amazing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,so when is games of the decade coming out
iRxJg2y2UqQ,apex legends is just one gamemode with one map with one play style. while cod mw has many many modes guns and maps. why
iRxJg2y2UqQ,5:08 who have it ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Amazon Prime game got like every second price
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Never noticed it but Falcon has a decent presentation voice. Could easily present nominees at an award ahow
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Before I start watching, I'm going to take a wild guess and say anthem ain't on the list"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Love your videos & agreed with plenty, but nothing for Sekiro...? Wow. Game of the year IMO. ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, with best multiplayer under it, wasnt well thought through before they put it in there, it should've been most unbalanced multiplayer of the decade, in every aspect"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Dammit man! .... I liked it better before, more gaming on-screen and less (to none) staff appearing !!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cyber punk never been more excited for a game in my life
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Isn’t the last of us part 2 also one of the most anticipated games in 2020 one of my anticipated games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Where is the MMORPG genre? World of Warcraft Classic, etc.?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So when do we get that Falcon face reveal?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Good shit guys, I liked this new style it was fun ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kinda mad that Astral Chain wasn't anywhere on this list.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Watched this while playing control happy to hear it getting the credit it deserves
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about the last of us 2 for most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Tbh, I really need a best android games list from a reputable organization...."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,if this was in 2013 the music section would be won by metal gear rising
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last of Us 2 wasn't even nominated for Most Anticipated???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I thought Jake's eating a pizza because he's gonna say Devil May Cry5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Well I was wrong
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No way I live right near the sun vet mall ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I thought Rage 2 was good?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best game = Days Gone 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The story, gameplay, music, free DLCs, the custom photo mode, characters and more."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order was one of the greatest games that I have played lmfao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The mall looks like the sun vet mall on long island
iRxJg2y2UqQ,ETIKA isnt going to experience the new animal crossing :'(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys are great, this video is awesome (:"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why does falcon never show his face? Is he part of the witness protection program?!?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How the hell is The Last of Us Part 2 not in the most anticipated category?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I wish Gameranx showed the percentages of votes in each category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Man, I played no new games this year"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mw as best multiplayer wtff the game is absolute dog shiiit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I really thought fallen order would be a nominee for best music
iRxJg2y2UqQ,CONTROL :D Good choice!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"FALCON LIVESTREAM weekly show , GIVE US THE BIRD"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My top 3 of 2019: The Outer Worlds, A Plague Tale: Innocence and Control. Good choice for your GOTY! Control is beyond fascinating IMO...."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Do we know what Falcon looks like yet?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Im watching this late but I  actually like where fallout 76 is going and think if you  go back and look at it now it'd  get a better review especially when wastelanders come out.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Bring the green screen and tux back!!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"for 2020 I'm most Hyped about Bloodlines 2. Which would be prob one of the 3 or 4 games out there that let you play as a Vampire, and the only one with today's graphics."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,10 years and I still don’t know if Falcon is an actual intelligent game loving bird or not
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No award for dmc...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,U  guys disappoint me....

iRxJg2y2UqQ,JAKE FROM GAMERANX HERE WITH ANOTHER GREAT YEAR OF VIDEO GAMES
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake made me order up a pizza. And that's definitely Andrew's Chicken Coop.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"What about sekiro ? Shesh the game hurt your ego , that's why it was not voted . Admit it !"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Could somebody recommend a game that is not RE2 that is fun and will keep me entertained . Thanks ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Some of these games aren't even out yet.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro didn't get a single award hmmm that's a problem
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How the hell was The Last of Us Part 2 not included in the most anticipated of 2020? There is no game I’m looking forward to more than TLoU2!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,05:39:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,06:12:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,that’s good pizza. Where can I find pizza like that?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"poor dmc 5, didnt win anything ;("
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not a lot of variety in there.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think the only game here that I have played is Link's Awakening.... The backlog is real!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,BEST SPORTS GAME OF THE YEAR??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"6:57 Wait, what? ""Doom eternal""? That was suposed to be a nominee last year, how did that get in again? Cheaters!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Oh... Wait... Bethesda...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is that falcon in the end?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I was happy to see Borderlands 3 nominated for game of the year, and it DEFINITELY should have won best design. Control looks great but we already have a bunch of hyper realistic looking games. How often do you see cell shading in games? And borderlands does it the best.and the world is so diverse. Im salty."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No love for Sekiro, huh"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,this video was posted on my birthday
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best music of the year will always be Nier: Automata for me.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is last of us 2 for best anticipating game??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love my PS4 (but I'm not a fan boi).... But I honestly feel that ps 4 fan boys and Hideo kojima fans are now simply TOXIC
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Was Jake in a dumpster at Prypyat?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Rage 2 FPS really was blast. Deserved nomination.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:00 The mold got him.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Should change the mobile category to 'best IOS game', most aren't even on android"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,For Most Anticipated you left out The Last of Us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima! WTH?! ?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Bruh The last of us part 2 for upcoming games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"We just gonna ignore ""Detroit become human"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I thinks it’s the biggest bs that modern warfare was even mentioned in this video
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Can I get a ""TLDW"" of this?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How to sum up this list:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,wE pIcKeD ModErN WarFaRe and YoU aLsO PicKeD ModErN WarFarE
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Soooo, most anticipated? Last of us?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game of 2020 and The Last of Us 2 isn’t on here ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern Warfare’s Multiplayer is ass dude. IMO.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,cal of duty skip forward call of duty
iRxJg2y2UqQ,",ll,,, skip more calll of duty omg this guy"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wheres smm2?! Its so good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kingdom hearts 3 had the best music dude
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm not a starwars fan but I just thought that jedi fallen order was a really good game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,13:34 rust
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The rare Sun Vet Mall cameo...  That collectible store Jake's standing in front of is literally littered with my childhood.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control’s story was pretty ass
iRxJg2y2UqQ,they forgot last of us 2 for most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I got hearted by you but I edited the comment (on another video)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern warfare is rated 3 or 2 stars but I don't know if its actually good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,my last 3 brain cells during a test: 20:34
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I know what's the best music in games! Just dance 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern warfare had a great story.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,what happened to your audio?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How could you even put animal crossing and cyberpunk on the SAME list?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""It's a game that ea didn't screw up"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Laughs in 200 dollar tomohawk
iRxJg2y2UqQ,what happened to yoda's ear?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This was well made!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why are you overrating Jedi Fallen Order this much? Did EA pay you?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Okay... Hold up, how many of you guys actually narrate on videos, there's Falcon, Jake who I only know, who're the rest?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro is my goty. I called it back in march
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Th Last of Us 2 nor Gohsts of Tsushima even mentioned on a list of the Most Anticipated Games of 2020? SMH
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex legends the only game Ea cared about
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So falcon peak reveal when?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro exodus deserved more :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,13:08 is that falcon??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Do more such honest videos :D
iRxJg2y2UqQ,bro just saying fallout 76 is awesome..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did falcon fly south for the winter?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think metro Exodus was much overlooked this year during the game awards
iRxJg2y2UqQ,time stamps would be useful for these kinds of videos
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why wasn’t MW on the game of the year award
iRxJg2y2UqQ,#1 the most ambitious rpg mobile project...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Got excited about that mobile game category until I found out they are all apple only
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My personal best games of 2019 are Metro Exodus, A Plague Tale: Innocence and Greedfall.  I reckon The Outer Worlds will be in there, once I play through it. Still gotta check out Star Wars & Control."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love the Geeks + Gamers shoutout
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No borderlands 3 in rpg?! EZ best in category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why the pizza ?.. high in the bed at 5 in tha morning......
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You always say its been a great year for video games and it makes me wonder if you were gaming when games were ACTUALLY good, not just hollow shells of a game with great graphics like they are now."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""No, I will never start a video like that."""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,-Jake 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Respect my friend.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,man outer worlds is just killin it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,and it does deserve it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I don't know how you losers could vote for delivery boy simulator for everything
iRxJg2y2UqQ,first the goat sim now a goose sim what are the odds whats next gerbil sim?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Need for Speed Heat on music? Not even a nominee?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,(Edit) Also not even a racing game category?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Well, now you gotta start a video with “WHATS UP GEEKS AND GAMERS”"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,hahahaha(-that was real!)HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is a racing game no longer worth mentioning?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Well, that was cringey."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,AN AWARD SHOW WITH NO CRINGE! WTF.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"10:06 ""I'm walking here"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,KH3 Was nominated for both the best rpg of 2019 and the biggest disappointment of 2019.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Pretty accurately describes the fandom.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Poor Metro Exodus :( In my opinion one of the best games.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Hey man, control is a good game...but oh my god they screwed up the model so much in the rendering process"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How was the last of us part 2 not nominated for most anticipated game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Best Mobile Game: CALL OF DUTY MOBILE ""Am I a joke to you?"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Once i saw them not have cyberpunk 2077 winning most anticipated game I knew they don""t know shit and left"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,metro exodus mentioned 2 times..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,cry sadly in the corner..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ksp 2 has more attention then animal crossing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Oxford English dictionary of GTFO ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I find it criminal that y'all didn't nominate Ace Combat 7 for the music genre
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Control is good, but not that good to won Game of the Year; same with Star Wars."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Resident Evil 3 Remake's not one of the most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about best racing and fighting game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I loved the music score in Days Gone alot, imo best of 2k19"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,TrAvIs ScOtT 1's
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"@gameranx, Is that shoppingtown mall?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I reckon Outer Worlds crippled themselves by not releasing on Steam immediately
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm more than likely just out of the loop but what's wrong with Rage 2? I've never played it but always thought it was a cool concept.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 was my favorite of the year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Luigi's Mansion 3 was robbed.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,where can I play outer wilds?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Every pick is subjective but the fact their most anticipated game is Doom really shocked me.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about perfect dark gamecube
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days gone’s sound design and combat was phenomenal. Definitely my GOTY
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This year wasn’t my favourite
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is TLOU Part 2 not among the most anticipated games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Id definitely nominate the last of us psrt 2 over animal crossing. TLOU has to have more fans anticipating that right.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,For my titanfall 2 is still my game of the year ????? or ig maybe apex but eh tf2 is still bets game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Am i just remembering the initial reactions to Control incorrectly? I remember it being received quite poorly and now it’s on all the best lists
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No mk11, what about sports category?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days Gone doesn't know what it wants to be... The story is just all over the place...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Very surprised TLOU2 wasn’t on Most Anticipated. ????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Disco Elysium was a great game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Can I just say... what a f***in' dope 2019 animation for the intro ? Gameranx (in my opinion) is hands down the most entertaining & enjoyable gaming channel on YouTube, happy holidays! ??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Gameranx brings you the top games of 2019. ""Sponsored by EA"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most disapointing game was for me Gears 5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Do you guys know what pizzagate is? I think you do.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2020 is going to be a great year for games... amiright?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Where is that mall they visited, I want to visit"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not including The last of us part 2 in most anticipated game 2020. What's wrong with you?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,do a games of the decade.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You know what the best mobile game is? 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,don't do it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Halo Infinite, Cyberpunk, Resident Evil 3, Elden Ring are all my most anticipated for next year."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control is so under rated. I’m glad it’s getting some recognition.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yay Disney Wars won game of the year Yay!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is that the source mall!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is this mall it looks like small town Canada at it's best?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,there's no botw? in open world
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Wait, is that Long Island :0?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why was there no category for racing games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Star Wars isn’t THAT good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I'm seriously disappointed by the lack of VR award. Anyway, it would go to Espire:1 anyway ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love how they just repeat the same games on almost every category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This man really stood in a garbage bin
iRxJg2y2UqQ,ace combat 7 was not on the list? :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control was so good...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And Sekiro didn't get anything?...i loved that game ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,? First 7 seconds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Isn't Falcon the dude at 4:51?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Great Editing its like oscars for games ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Finally some pizza on screen
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My Friend Pedro with the snub of 2019?? its all love tho ! ??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why was far cry new dawn a contender for anything?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wtf! Most anticipated 2020game LAST OF US 2 not even mentioned!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I would have put Code Vein as a nominee for Best Music, the game is quite underrated."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro is my game of the year baby
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yall gonna hate me but i honestly have never heard of Control until now
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"YESSS, thank you for putting Days Gone in there, it is so clearly a labour of love, and I don't think it got enough time in the light due to stronger (not by too much) titles overshadowing it"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro Exodus was so slept on ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Was the intro a jab @ Geeks + Gamers ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where’s hollow knight
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Andrew: ""What just happened?"" "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,LMAO!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mw is trash lol sry this is the 1st cod I havent bought since the original mw
iRxJg2y2UqQ,now i want pizza! >:-|
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WHAT'S UP GEEKS AND GAMERS?!?!?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I was hoping to see Celeste for best indie but good list nonetheless
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Finally , I was expecting Control to be the best!??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Outer Worlds was a trash RPG. Weak leveling system, dull weapons and armor, boring combat and uninspired locales."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Naughty dog: Am I a joke to you?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Sekiro for art/world design :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,kinda disappointed that persona 5 royal wasnt even in the nominee for most aniticipated game for 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Whu what are you doing are you eating soup” had me dying lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly felt Sekiro would get some awards at least if not The GOTY. But looks like everyone likes guns better than Katanas :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn Killer Queen Black didn’t even get a nominee for multiplayer? It’s phenomenal
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon's awesome ??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I must be in the minority, but I actually like Rage 2"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Sorry katana zero, you did ya best. Honorable mention to blasphemy from me"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,7:49 what about gta 5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lol who’s idea was it to do this? Haha it’s just so....random lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This is the most awkward video I’ve ever watched
iRxJg2y2UqQ,was kingdom hearts 3 bad compared to the others in the series? i ask because i havent played it yet and i agree with anthem being most disappointing it has disappointed me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake Baldino takes a stroll through the abandoned towns to list games.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I can't find Outlanders on the playstore is it only a apple game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"jake, can i have that other slice of pizza"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When risk of rain 2 did not even get nominatee
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Interesting choice picking DOOM Eternal over Cyberpunk 2077...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Came for the games stayed for the pizza...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake; Why were you whispering in a nearly abandoned place?... Afraid to pay the ghost?...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best sports game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So glad you chose Control as your GOTY. I loved that game so much; it's amazing. I was a little sad when I finished it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I really think a Plague Tale should have been nominated for Best Music.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Who the hell had expectations from freaking breakpoint?! Wildlands was open world, third person shooty shooty, bang bang game #1394"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No Pokemon love? I don't know that it would have won anything, but I can't believe it wasn't even mentioned. It definitely could have been in the best music category; it was surprising how good the music was in that game."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So I feel like Exodus got robbed on a few of those.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Also, side note, no mention of Last of Us II for most anticipated made me a little salty"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How tf is the last of us 2 not a most anticipated nominee
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Screw doom cyberpunk is my choice
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why didn`t Last Of Us 2 even get a nominee on most anticipated game ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not a single award for DMC 5?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Erm... most anticipated game catgory and Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us part 2 aren't even nominated?! Treason, of the highest order. ??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,<3 you Falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,isnt sekiro rpg too?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So... Warcraft III Reforged for most disapointing 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Here's to more gameranks in 2020!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I have spoken.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last of us part 2 is my most anticipated game of 2020.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The only gripe I have with the star wars for game of the year is that it's way too damn short, great game but not enough to do especially since all the collectibles are just cosmetics, and not many great boss battles"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That's all.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Have you never seen tom clancy’s rainbow six siege?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Last of us part 2 not in most anticipated for 2020? Crazy.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,God so help me if they choose Control for game of the year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,BRUH OUTER WORLDS HAD THE BEST NARRATIVE
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No award to dmc5
iRxJg2y2UqQ,when MW wins the best multiplayer game and I feel like it's the biggest disappointment. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Not saying is awful, but it's nowhere near BO2, MW2, MW3, or any other CoD. Infinite Warfare had a better campaign, Multiplayer is awful, and co-op is buggy as hell"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days gone story is underrated af. So is a plague tale. And how can ghost recon be disappointing if you know it’s gonna be shit in the first place
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The dude in the Travis Scott's at the end looks like he rummages through people's medicine cabinets at house parties.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No nomination for best music for Metro Exodus is a robbery, music in a finale hour of game is just insane"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Edit : Holy shit, that was a robbery, but no nomination for game of the year is scandalous"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Who’s the guy with shoe game? I saw him with the Obsidian Jordan 1’s and the Travis Scott 1’s towards the end. Fire bro
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is it bad I haven't heard of 98% of these games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The most anticipated game is one and only GTA 6
iRxJg2y2UqQ,These days I only play cod mw 2019 against the bots and re~do the mission's (offline) and Grid 2019 (offline). 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Online multiplayer sucks.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,no classic World of warcraft even nominated for best rpg?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So that's what falcon looks like. Cool
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Aight this is dope but where is game of the decade?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Multiplayer: Halo Reach
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is last of us 2 not on most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Its weird how metro exodus got none of the awards
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about the best co op games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"this year sucked for gaming.  when you feel call of duty was the best game to play, thats how you know"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I'm glad to see Fallen Order getting a lot of recognition. Despite some the bugs it really is a good game, which is surprising coming from EA."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Bring back Skyrim vids
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You showing the games or your faces?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,no last of us 2 for most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,For fps where ia far cry new dawn
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2020 gonna be a lot of competition.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised no VR category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Whats up to your man in black suit?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When jake gets oldino he will be baldino
iRxJg2y2UqQ,the last of us ii
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I just wanna know why, RAID SHADOW LEGENDS isn't the best mobile game of all time tbh"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Always read it as gamer-anx
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Remakes don't count.  You can't say an old game is game of the year even if it was remade.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You didn't put anthem in the ""best graphics"" list?  I feel like that was literally the only thing they got right with the game. The team behind the graphics knows what they're doing and they deserve recognition. Feel like all they get is hate. No worries tho, if it were in there there'd be a little controversy"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer wilds or Star Wars?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No borderlands love ? Wth
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro Exodus is the best FPS of the year not COD ?? Destiny 2 shadowkeep is not a new game is a boring dlc so  stop with this stuped ????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,12yr olds be like: FORTNITE!?!?!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,There’s no way rage 2 is disappointing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"When I heard ""Dangerous Driving"" I was like... Who the hell have thought that they should name a game like that... It's so lame like blatantly lame, it's like naming your first child ""Gray Couch""."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated should of been 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,•cyberpunk 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,•resident evil 3 remake
iRxJg2y2UqQ,•dying light 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The one year you could have said ""This has been a horrible year for games""."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about south park 64
iRxJg2y2UqQ,umm. WHERE IS TLOU2?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It says something about the coming year that the Remake of FFVII is not the most anticipated game of 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys really need some more apex clips . Smh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,where is Days gone?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How and what does someone have to do to get a job there??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I personally feel like Resident Evil 2 shoulda got atleast one more award, that was a damn fine game that one."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"What about Resident Evil 3??? For me it's a ""must have"" next April (Cyberpunk 2077 too)"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,that abandoned mall and ex-toys r us store are just sad...... :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No best VR title? :c
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What is this everyone looks so tired
iRxJg2y2UqQ,REmake 2 and Sekiro were easily the best this year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mobile games include none of them 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Eg : fortnite 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Pubg mobile 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cod mobile 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thanks ?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Every category basically had the same games over and over ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,he died from the mold in the helmet.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The most disappointing game of 2019 was Wolfenstein Youngblood for me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mario maker 2?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait what? Fallen Order is not Metroidvenia style... Wtf?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RE2 and Starwars over Sekiro? Ok ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,GTA 6 is coming out summer holidays
iRxJg2y2UqQ,finally someone gave credits to Days Gone and Control! such good games that didn't have the attention they deserved. great channel
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why does nobody ever talk about how great The Surge 2 is?    Top 3 game of the year with Sekiro and Star Wars.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best game of the year goes to that pizza
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So the most anticipated games are remakes or one original IP ... and ya'll picked the remakes rofl
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Were any of those mobile games available on Android?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How long was votes up for? Seems really small pool and ign-y
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why no Last of Us part  2 for most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Astral chain did not get any love this year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I loved breakpoint
iRxJg2y2UqQ,7:40 I thought theyre gonna show an actual falcon with Falcon voice overs
iRxJg2y2UqQ,A whole fail as always gamer rancid
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What does anyone think about rage 2?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,They didn't even nominate Half Life:Alyx for most anticipated game. IT'S A NEW HALF LIFE GUYS
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Please open a Patreon Page... Don't be dependent on the you tube
iRxJg2y2UqQ,no re2 for best looking?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days Gone Mention @7:39
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i think Andrew died from the arsenic in those helmets
iRxJg2y2UqQ,disappointed I didn't see Raid Shadow Legends smh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"How come the ""Best Games"" video is so poorly edited compared to literally every other video on your channel :D"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised metro exodus didn't make it to best style or best narrative
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"really, no minecraft?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hell yeah Apex I will never stop apex & I hate call of duty modern warfare and control is my favorite game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You should make a 20 minute video of Jake eating
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is last of us part 2 not a most anticipated game. First last of us was the best game ever
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is everyone hating on fallout 76
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How come Fallen order wasn't even nominated for best music?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why are the nominations for best multiplayer game only shooting/fighting games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fallout 69 Game of the year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised metro exodus didn't make it to best style
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Gears 5? Where WTF!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No love for Judgment?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How did last of us 2 not make the list for most anticipated games for 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm glad these choices of yours are irrelevant because Sekiro is GOTY and DMC 5 best action game ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer Worlds is GotY by far. Star Wars is 2nd
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ultimate? No mention of it? Crazy.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where's R6??!?! :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No best strategy game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Open world DAY Z?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro took my heart this year. My GOTY period ??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,the award for most overrated game goes to:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,star wars jedi: fallen order
iRxJg2y2UqQ,horaaaayyyy
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow Animal Crossing in the list of most anticipated game of 2020 but The Last of Us Part 2 isn't? Such a bummer :3
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So Jake randomly owns a camo suit...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Dissappointed... Not to have nominated Raid shadowlegends
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The fact that they nominated fire emblem makes me happy
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You really going to not nominate the last of us 2 for 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is Skyrim not the number one open world game despite the release date
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cod mw good game ?? ...  im out
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Resi 2 not on the best looking graphics list?!!?!?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,CoD wins Award

iRxJg2y2UqQ,MOST ANTECIPATED GAME THE LAST OF US 2 / GHOST OF TSUSHIMA
iRxJg2y2UqQ,what's up geeks and gamers?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love that you guys are from long island
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You're telling me last of us 2 is not a nominee for most anticipated game of 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why haven't you put Call of Duty: Mobile for mobile nominees
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"1. KH3 should've been atleast nominated in the ""best music"" category"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"2. Why was KH3 on the ""most disappointing games"" category if it was nominated as ""best rpg"" just doesn't make any sense"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Ugh, ""Metroidvania"". Really guys?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did anyone else feel disappointed by Star warsI mean it was a good game no argument but after you beat it what is there left to do
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I dont get why theres a most disappointing game section when the title is best games 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wtf where is borderlands 3 for the open world games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about the last of us 2 for 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,On me the best graphics is rdr2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No racing games? NFS Heat? Nothing???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Nothing for Borderlands?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,whats with the cringy changing of places where you talk about who wins what?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No best mmorpg?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Stopped at 1:58, Borderlands 3 didn't even get a nomination for Best Multiplayer? I know the game was far from perfect, but to not even get a mention? Come on."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"5:20, least it got one mention"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Okay, make it four in total. I'll wait till the end next time."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Y is KH3 on disappointed list?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,call of duty modern warfare is very well deserved they really put some effort into it !
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer Worlds is the best game of the year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I vote Metro Exodus for all these categories
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow. There were much better RPG's released in 2019 than what was listed. Also getting tired of The Division 2 being called an RPG.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No code vein mention atleast ????. How the hell did far cry new dawn even get a mention
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Rainbow six siege by far the best multiplayer game/ graphics game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is The Last of Us 2 not nominated for most anticipated game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,NO ACE COMBAT 7 !!!?? FOR MUSIC ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Andrew: *Wakes up Confused ""What Just Happend"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is there not a best horror game award?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon camera shy or hiding his weight?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No best strategy game award?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best style should have been GRIS
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Woooooow! I really feel Fire emblem: Three houses should have gotten more representation here. Oh well, cheers"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,THIS IS BETTER THAN THE OSCARS AND GRAMMYS
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jeez 2019 was not a good year for games. 2018 had so many.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Ghost of Tsushima or TLOU Part II on most antecipated????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yo @gameranx how did you put a mic on a falcon?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yes. Control is a masterpiece from Finland. Allways liked remedy games.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Baba is you"" is the best indie game of 2019"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is falcon a guy or just a bird? I'm confused
iRxJg2y2UqQ,07:24:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: THE LAST OF US! 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is there not best fighting game I'd give it to mortal kombat 11
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel The Outer Worlds and RE2 should’ve been in more categories on this list. I think they’re really good games and should get more credit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I honestly don't understand a lot of these nominations and winners.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wasn’t fallen order super buggy?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I dunno mk11 had some good graphics
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcons name is Andrew?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sikro was the big hit for me I just started playing it and I love it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I was waiting for horror genre ?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Don’t know about you guys, but this is how I shop for games."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Title is self explanatory. First 1:31 minutes waste of time.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Whoever threw in Destiny 2 for best multiplayer game obviously doesn't play PVP.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Waiting for Angry Joes version
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Can we just get Falcon to do all the Video game Awards nominees the voice is on point
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The GOTY are Control and a star wars game ? Really ? Those choices are bad
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Resident evil 2 remake was great but honestly imho Star Wars fallen order should be goty
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Doom eternal? Are you guys braindead?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Are you eating soup? "" My favorite quote of 2019"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My most hyped game for 2020 is TLOU 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best sports game ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys have a list of nominees for most anticipated game of 2020, but The Last of Us Part 2 wasn't on the list?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How isn't call of duty moden warfare the best game of the year?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Top 3 games 2019 imo
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Sekiro, Metro exodus, and RE2"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ghost of tsushima and Cyberpunk 2077
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No racing car games..?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How was RDR2 not in the best graphics category??????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro Exodus got no rewards??? What
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game of 2020 doesn't include the Last of Us part 2. You guys are idiots
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro Exodus is underrated af
iRxJg2y2UqQ,you guys should do a top mmo thing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where Dragon Ball Z Kakarot tho?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about horror games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,17:22 dat costume!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ahhh the mobile games look so good ! But all iOS games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"EA didn’t screw up Apex? They asked 175$ for an axe, sorry bruv but that’s about as scummy as it gets."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,oof warframe was not on here
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Happy to see Apex, spent so much time on it this year. Definetly my GOTY, simply because I barely played anything else."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why are literally all the mobile game nominees not on Android?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Outer Worlds open world nomination????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was god??of??war
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is it game-ranx or gamer-anx?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It surprise me A Plague Tale didnt even make to best game of the year haha.. and didnt realize Control was that good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about rdr 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wtf no rdr 2 for best graphics at console! Bull crap
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last Of Us Part 2 is not on most anticipated of 2020? Get out of here.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"lol, DMC5 doesn’t get best action adventure? You guys should check on your definitions, survival horror is not action adventure, cause you know, SH is its own genre...as a matter of fact, the game you choose, created said  genre, like 20 years ago ?????"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I have no faith in Gameranks viewers,  you guys consistently pick the dumbest games ever.  Smh"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The best part about this is that it’s not just listing off the games, the locations and comedic things at the end, fallout 76 and the hotdog, make it worth watching, nice job guys"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Can we just agree it's bullshit that all of the mobile games mentioned, which honestly look pretty cool, aren't available on Android? Why does this problem continue to persist?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Millions of people and a few in the office ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love his voice when he announces the games.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,have you played sekiro????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Last Of Us 2 for Most Anticipated???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Are all of the mobile games for IOS?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer worlds ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Last time I was this early, Fallout 76 had potential"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Imo I think ace combat 7 had the best music
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I think you guys forgot The Last of Us 2 in anticipated. Have you seen the gameplay demo? It's insane how good that game looks. It was obvious Cyberpunk 2077 would win, but still think Animal Crossing is less anticipated than The Last of Us 2."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I NEVER cry and I was balling at the end of Metro Exedus. cmon now the narrative was crazy good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why tf is sekiro not in at least half of those categories
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why does game ranx have so much shoe game???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No racing category? ????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yea
iRxJg2y2UqQ,But have you ever played raid shadow legends
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 needs more love like cmon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why falcon always hiding.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What's up geeks and gamers
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel bad for malls. Most are crazy depressing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"COD number 1, best game series and Modern Warfare is best game of 2019"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro exodus is really slept on we’re the fans at?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,mw?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Reveal Falcon’s face for 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fire emblem three houses should have won
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Calling Resident Evil 2 action adventure is a huge stretch. What a cop out
iRxJg2y2UqQ,At least someone is giving DaysGone the love it deserves. DaysGone is my GotY. Still playing Control
iRxJg2y2UqQ,all i wanted was a nice car game to play but i guess not
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hard to believe ff7 didn't get the most anticipated.  Must be a very limited pool of voters.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cant beleive  A plague tale innocence couldnt make any nomination either .. unbelievable
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So hyped for Halo Infinite
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2020 Game & The Last of Us 2 WASN’T IN THE LIST!! Are you mental!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,ISN'T anyone fan of BATTLEFIELD??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best open world is sea of thieves
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Raid- shadow legends ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"We get it, people foam at the mouth for Norman Reedus..."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Last of us 2 hello??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about racing games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I don't understand how a game can be game of the year when it came out at the end of the year (November 8, 2019) was the release date."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,For the phones we have these days mobile is lacking bad
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"So, fallout 76 wasn’t disappointing?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about wonder Boy with fruit and shit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is the best strand game category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Console exclusives should not be in the ""Game of the year"" category. ""Here's Gears of Halo Advanced Persona Elite Raider 11 for the Game Station!"" Wins every category, only on one of 4 consoles."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jake ""every meal is pizza-time and out of breath from hanging from a branch for 10 seconds"" Baldino, everyone!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro should be goty
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake: How do I look? Tired?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,looks at desk
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I miss Kings canyon so much
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kingdom hearts 3 should've won best soundtrack
iRxJg2y2UqQ,“Modern warfare has a solid multiplayer”
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Claymores and 725 have entered chat
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2019 is Sekiro
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not gonna lie but Falcon lookin thicc
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kinda sad that GreedFall didn’t get nominated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Black Desert Mobile is the apex of what the mobile platform can offer and plays well on crap phones like my old coolpad.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I don’t want to sound like the bad guy but I can’t wait for Kojima to buy either the MGS franchise or Konami itself.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro lost? Lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"How can any exclusive be considered ""best"" when only a subset of people can play it?  How about ""these are the best games, IN THE HISTORY OF GAMING!, with the words 'Apex Legends' in the name?"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Choose only those that are made for all (or at least a decent subset (>1) of other platforms.)  If people are opposed to being robbed by game companies, exclusives raise the bar to mafioso level.  Sotto voce: ""Psst. Hey bub.  Youse wanna play dis game here?  Just `invest' a little extra for the console.  Don't worry,  youse'll be able to play alla dem old games on it.  Heh, heh."""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 got boring really fast
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""Best games of 2019"" you mean every game of 2019?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Best mobile game goes to What The Golf instead of Call of Duty: Mobile, are you serious. But hey kudos to them just for that, still the overall mobile games of 2019 are pretty good. Hope to see more quality mobile games of 2020 and beyond."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,where is sekiro :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fallout 76 should have been on the trash list.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"hey there i usualy enjoy youre videos , but this one !!!!! it seems more like a advert , youve used the same over and over game , that are base line boring , please get back to the good ontent or i will have to unsubscribe ."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,18:43 the best moment of the video and the 2019 gaming.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mk 11 should have won
iRxJg2y2UqQ,how is fallout 76 not in the most disappointing list?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fire Emblem: Three Houses is still an underrated game. GG guys
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel like I'm the only person who has neither heard anything about nor seen anyone play Control.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Days Gone was my pick too, I actually loved it and the twist ending was pretty cool"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Plague tale innocence is underrated fam.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,how did division 2 get a nomination like what?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best narrative is plague tale innocence.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RISK OF RAIN 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,REMNANT RISE 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,METRO EXEDUS 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,are all 10/10 games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Gotta love how they didn’t put fortnite in any of the categories. RESPECT
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shave the neck beard man for your sake
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about Mario kart gamecube
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The most anticipated of 2020 is automatically a joke since the Last of Us 2 isn't on it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What mall was that?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro exodus is a really good game but I still can’t believe the year the decade is ending
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is that Sunvet mall?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I would say that Control and Metro:Exodus was better. Especially Control looks great with DXR features on and I thing that it's brutalist architecture and destructible environment was really nice.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think a lot of this is pretty agreeable and I like your channel a lot but seriously? John Williams did the music for Fallen order and it wasn't even nominated??? Buuuuullllllshiiiiiit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Also sekiro deserved at least one award
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"y’all have some of if not my most respected opinions on video games on this platform, not only was it a great year for video games but it was a great year for gameranx see y’all in 2020"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Less overrated generic shooter please
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is falcon a real bird??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I couldn't find the single mobile game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Titan fall 2 all I have to say
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro game of the year for me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"UNREAL.  Do you guys even look at your lists?!?!  First of all, all of them share like 3-4 of the SAME game, super creative. "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Second, are you SURE this is as safe and mainstream as you could possibly make a list? "
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"4:15 and our sponsor for this video, raid shadow legends"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,17:20 I love that Jake is Hawt Dawg Man!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is it me or when I first saw Jake stand up from the dumpster I swear the scene looks like it was shot with a green screen until he tapped the dumpster for the announcement. ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I have a bad feeling that Cyberpunk 2077 could be another Anthem. Way too much hype for this game. I hope I'm wrong.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,There is a clear reason why most of these guys are never on camera.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is getting over it in this!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was Remnant From the Ashes in several of these categories?? >:(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Didn't really expect this video to be unique but great job guys!  I've seen pretty much every before you buy and can confidently say I enjoy this odd but enjoyable change of pace
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Watch at 1.5x speed or this is unbearably slow
iRxJg2y2UqQ,most anticipated game list didnt even include the last of us part 2 smh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did you really need to include those breaks from the list?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Man.... I must have played a different version of control ... I thought it was super average and the abilities were about as boring as you can make them( given the idea sounds awesome).  Here we go empty office space, boiler room, giant polygonal void...??"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Congratulations at making it big guys!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Let see for me I had three great deals
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I got a PS3 for $50 and The Kingdom Hearts All in One Package for $32 on PSN and my cousins gave me all of their PS2 and PS1 games which included Destroy all Humans, War of The Monsters and the original Star Wars Battlefront 2 and a lot more though makes me sad how Spyro 2 was treated"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"One of my favourite game call code vein and it didn't show up, so I am bit upset, but I am glad devil may cry 5 got show up so many times so I am satisfied with this already"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Remnant from the ashes didn’t get enough attention I believe
iRxJg2y2UqQ,3:26 RE2 wasn't nominated? What the hell?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That'd be cool if the makers of control would do a new Max Payne game similar to the first ones style.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Here at 420k views :)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys definitely spent more time editing this video versus worst of and I love it!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Bro mobile games suck like i remember there were some good ones but they are mostly pay to win so imma stick with the PC thank you
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Woooow, what about the Last of Us 2 for 2020 releases?!??!?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is it bad that I never heard of control ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I am so happy that Fallen order won the last one
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sad MHW didint show up anywhere
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Damn, none of those mobile games on the Google store. Sad bois"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The last of us 2 not on most anticipated? Yeah okay great video
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow I'm surprised at the Game of the Year. Not my choice but it was great game so I can see why someone would choose it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,But before this topic let's talk about raid shadow legends
iRxJg2y2UqQ,apex legends give me a break
iRxJg2y2UqQ,DOOM eternal>halo infinite?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"9:20 I think FIFA needs more recognition for the music in the games, every year they find new amazing artists and give them the spotlight and they are always hits"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,cringy :D
iRxJg2y2UqQ,good shiet!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,how was gears 5 not considered one of the best looking games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Deffo gonna try out controle
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You left out last of us 2 in most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I don't think I'll be playing anything on the next gen consoles, with the way the gaming industry is headed. We've had so many greedy predatory tactics, unfinished and broken games recently. Albeit not every game has been like that but the majority have. I think it's time for me to step away from gaming for now."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why do so many people have such a hard time saying Sekiro?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The sheer lack of respect for Disco Elysium in these awards is embarrassing.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,LOU2 not on most anticipated games are you for real!??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is there someone who doesnt love falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly I thought last year had better games I only bought three games this year and one was from last year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How was rage 2 a disappointing game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Its a shame the last of us isn't on the anticipated games list
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro lucky asf fallen order came out late.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,re2 was mega robbed in so many categories
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It would have been better if you displayed the operating/console systems.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How about best puzzle game? I think Supraland. It's really good.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised kh3 didn't get nominated for music award
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You forgot last of us 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,gameranx is in Long Island!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,To anyone seeing this! PLAY CONTROL. It wasn't advertised well enough! But it deserves this award so much!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Last of Us Part 2 will win best narrative next year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So borderlands 3 isn't a rpg anymore?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My favorite games of 2019 are Resident Evil 2 Remake and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This whole video is Gold. Love how it's randomly organized.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,When Jake was eating pizza and said he is starving while im in my bed watching this at 4 am and my insomniac ass hasnt eaten in around 7 hours lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,DAT SOYBOY AINT NO FALCON
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"ghost recon breakpoint, i know some people are going to get mad about that-"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,me: im getting MAD
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Playing anthem while watching this lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,im early so i guess i have to say something to show that.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Just happy that bl3 was nominated for best game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro is my GOTY and one of my fav games of all time. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order was good but not GOTY.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I like how winded jake got from climbing a tree. maybe skip the next pizza bro. thanks for a great year guys.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,God loves y’all fr don’t be sad and feel alone remember God is always is on your side
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m pleased with the fallen order awards.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Bruh wheres Tlou Part 2 on the most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Time to work on your cardio Jake. You're becoming a cliche, lol."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think 2019 was pretty lackluster.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Every ""big"" game was hyped up a ton, then it came out and then.....meh."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days gone is real glitchy.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,best games for mobile any video ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RTS games?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Looked like good pizza
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands was kinda disappointing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Flexing those TS AJ1
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Slurping solid food should be illegal
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wtf rdr2 hard the best graphics
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex Legends is
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most Disappointing game of the year:Modern Window Claymore Warfare
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Guys Should I get Call of Duty : Modern Warfare (PC)? Is it worth ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I will get it for 25$
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days gone was the best game of 2019 it had updates improving it and making it best. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,If u agree like
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about conkers bad fur day
iRxJg2y2UqQ,choosing DS in the best graphics is so wrong. that 'game' can't offer anything except for freaking rocks and rivers.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"best looks is not about technology, it's also art, and I simply can't see art through this greenish gray blackness"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Does no one like Star Wars Jedi fallen order??? UNTIL IT GOT GOTG
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Very off topic but I wonder how many malls across the country look like that because the one in my town is exactly the same. It's practically been abandoned.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Who else thinks there should have been top sports game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,it really wasn't a good year for video games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why no Greedfall?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,cs 1.6 bro...that's it :X
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WHATS UP GEEKS AND GAMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!11
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Deep rock galactic  is my number 1
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""apex legennds....its respawn at their best"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"....uh......titanfall 2, even fallen order?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,*metro exodus*
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I woulda voted for osrs  for best mobile lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The most disappointing game is cube world.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Gears 5 is a great game but it is not getting the credit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last of Us Part 2 should have been at least a nominee of most anticipated for 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"tbh, Modern warfare was a disappointment. the campaign was too short, the multiplayer is bland, and co-op is impossible. to me, it was a letdown."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most Anticipated game of 2020 should be Last of Us 2!! wtf!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lmao @ 7:40
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Calls himself a uncreative basted and then continues to “Jump straight into it” – like another Defranco – Nice I see what you did there.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"13:55, so glad he said something, I was wondering why was carrying a Goose."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The whole time I thought the show was called ""Gamer-Anx"", mind blown, it's ""Game-Ranks""."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"9:18 Dude, where did you get your Pins."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,YO when will ya'll CG Falcon into one of these videos so we can have the whole Gameranx crew in one spot????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"6:26 fix your diet , trust me , at old age you always will regret it , even in young age you dont know what your missing in terms of health , mental energy , and even inner well being"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I was expecting at the start a raid shadow legends ad, and then for the best mobile games he would say: “We think the best mobile is raid shadow legends"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly the outer worlds feels like a better fo4
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Will just say that maybe add music when presenting all of the awards. It feels kind of weird hearing the names of the games without some music.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is that Jersey pizza? If so...i'm jealous. Looks amazing and I miss it dearly in California.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:46 me at the end of 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about Boneworks? It's a revolutionary game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"13:05 ""Andy's Chicken Shack"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Seeing that Apex footage made me miss Kings Canyon more than I thought I ever would
iRxJg2y2UqQ,10:27 I don't understand.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Now i want all the videos to be like this. That's it!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Division 2 had a great soundtrack. Ambient and atmospheric. My choice for best of 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No live shows lately? :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"'Takes off mask'  ""what just happened?""??? Great vid guys been here for a while and love your vids ?keep up the awesome work. Love you falcon ? ik it's not a falcon but close enough lol."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game... How does animal crossing make it in and not watch dogs legions
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did they just take a shot a Jeremy at the beginning?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I am very happy to know that star wars Jedi fallen order wins the gameranx Game of the year award
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Metro Exodus, Resident Evil 2, Doom Eternal and Dying Light 2 for me the best."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer wilds deservers more attention. One of the best games i have ever played.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2 GAME OF THE YEAARRRR
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did Jake dress up as Hawt dawg Man?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shout out to the Maine license plate pin you had on your jacket!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,best mp mw what with that thick sbmm
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Hey Jake, you... you good?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No last of us 2 ? I'm so hyped for it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,look at all that caffeine on Jake's desk.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No Warframe in it??? Great graphics, awesome Devs, reall F2P system, great community, awesome Lore, great updates, etc."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,this video is proof of why i always recommend gameranx and why jake is so funny and also why i wish you guys did some sort of live action stuff like old cow chop and creatures videos.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Wolfenstein Young Blood should have at least been nominated for most disappointed game. Just so God awful, hopefully the next one won't be anything like it, if they so make another."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,To me breakpoint was the let down of the decade
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where the anime games at come on Bru
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20 minutes of the same titles
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was fallout 76 for best RPG?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Dying Light 2 is my most anticipated.  Cyberpunk a very close second
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I came prepared to riot if outerworlds didn't get best rpg. I am happy.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 gets way too little love
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is the racing category at??????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"It seems difficult to fail as game if you have ""Star Wars"" in your title, if even such an okay/mediocre game like Fallen Order  gets so much praise. I wonder how EA have been failing for so long."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mix of RE2remake and DMC5.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer Worlds beats Disco Elysium for best RPG?!? Yea um NO.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Star wars is just an inferior version of sekiro except in graphics, so I am not really sure about that.."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,does falcon ever reveal himself?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"what is ""best style""?? u have too much useless or duplicated nominations."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Call and apex are 2 of the best PvP games of this year for me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated games of 2020? You forgot the best one. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The last of us part 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best Multiplayer is destiny 2 in my opinion now that forsaken and shadow keep has fixed it and made it better
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This Jordan 1 Travis Scot are looking nice ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No RDR2 love wow
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How you not gonna mention my boy dying light
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best Graphics
iRxJg2y2UqQ,gameranx: Not Battlefield
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: Ever  heard of Frostbite?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think little misfortune should be the best Narrative game :3
iRxJg2y2UqQ,SD Gundam G Generation Cross Rays was a big surprise for me. I got 80 hours just this month and im just half way. LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Its just game awards but way better, and without the constant stories and off time. I love this"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn flexin the travis scott AJ1
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WHERE THE LAST OF US 2??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best shooter should have been metro also goty
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How much do they pay you to say certain games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex Legends. Call of Duty. Seriously? There the SAME GAME in multiplayer.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mordhau is at least an ORIGINAL game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No COD mobile? Feels overlooked, it is easily the most advanced mobile game out."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It ok you can say it. 2019 was not a great year for games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I might check out Control
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Was that Louis C.K, ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The hönkening
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jedi: Fallen Order deserves every award it gets. So good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RESIDENT EVIL 2 IS THE GOTY . BEST TIME I HAD GAMING IN ALONG TIME
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Shots fired lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,sees modern warfare won best multiplayer
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yeahhh im outta here.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,3rd comment because I am just so tilted over this list.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You shortlisted Fire Emblem for GOTY out of nowhere but overlooked a lot of the other award winners in the list.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Most disappointing game of the year hands down, no question is definitely Mortal Kombat 11.."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The fact that last of us part 2 wasn’t on the most anticipated list is a crime
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love fallen order and it is finally recognized for its greatness
iRxJg2y2UqQ,unprofessional and confusing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Borderlands 3 is underrated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What is the best game of 2019? 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And why is it Disco Elysium? 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Comment below.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is The Last of Us 2 not on the most anticipated of 2020 list?? Bizarre.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys did the witch 3 dirty tho
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel like RE2 was definitely the single-player game of the year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly Metro Exodus was my favorite
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Anyone else think COD mobile got robbed?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,man myth legend
iRxJg2y2UqQ,jus better for me to think ur an actual falcon. Jake rocks.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This is only channel which is showing some love for Days Gone
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Video starts @ 1:35
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last Of Us part 2 and Gohst of Tsushima should have been on most anticipated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,#1. Raid shadow legends
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex Legends Cancer on earth
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Im just happy Destiny2 is here
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lmfao. Your community is comprised of twelve year olds.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Can we just agree that 2019 was dogshit for gaming overall?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Vote for Best Real-time strategy game of 2019 and the nominees are:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,1-Total War: Three Kingdoms
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2-Age of Empires II Definitive Edition
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"For me personally, game of the year is Metro Exodus.. that game got the most emotion out of me and made me feel things the most and is the most memorable.."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How is the division2 an RPG? Guns and gear with random stats does not make a game an RPG..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The last of us part 2 wasn't even nominated in the most anticipated games category,  that's some BS"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,what a shat year for gaming
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex has won my heart as multiplayer of 2019.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,FALCON is always hiding.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Like a  CHICKEN  hawk - lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cringed every time someone nominated cod.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ghost Recon needs to go back to its roots
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"This video is just hilarious, I came here for the winners but I finished laughing off from these guys' hilarious shits. I love Gameranx!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys are some of the best , most down to earth video game reviewers on YouTube. Here’s to an amazing game filled 2020"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""WHATSUPPP GEEKS AND GAMERSSS!!!!!"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,5:47 It's pizza time
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control has a great design language. I finished it last week. However for GOTY? Idk. It's a solid game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Also Most Antecipated not Cyberpunk? Uhm, weird"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Hell yeah, Jake with Freedom Fighters on PS2! Talk about a game that needs a remaster, dang... I'd pre-order and camp for that!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My personal favourite RPG and Open-World was Outward. I just really fell in love with it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,07:28:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I approve ... Thanks for the support gameranx
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm gonna be so bummed out when/if we see Falcon and it turns out he's not an actual Falcon.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,:'(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love the mall stuff! I'm new to the channel this year but keep up the good work in 2020!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,C O D M O D E R N W A R F A R E a n d D E A T H S T R A N D I N G
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Me: * proceeds to think of other games *
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I know I am on the minority here but apex legends was only fun for like two weeks and now is just kinda trash.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No love for Disco Elysium.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,6:12 who de hell slurps on pizza?? ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,11:30 division 2 could be mentioned aswel
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn. I really believed Fallen Order should be in more of these categories and won more prices.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Dang, no love for Metro I see."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love the ghillie suit...and bright blue sneakers :P
iRxJg2y2UqQ,omg i finally got to see what falcon looks like. yaaa
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2:52 who are you? Jake always introduces himself :P
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Also you 4:50
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Buddy with the Travis Scott’s just flexing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jake jumping out of a tree is probably the best thing I have ever seen
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"i was expecting FInal Fantasy 14 to pop up at least once in a couple of catagories, but all of the games arent bad choices. im still hyped for the FF7 remake though and thought that would have won for most anticipated game of 2020"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why was last of us 2 not nominated for most anticipated game 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m surprised that Last if Us 2 wasn’t in the 2020 category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Andrew passed out from repertory issues.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Real surprised Blasphemous didn’t make it into the best style
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Breakpoint would have been fine if it wasn't for the loot and inventory system.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"LOL, star wars won an award?? Yeah i guess its that type of video."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,falcon face reveal should be one of the most anticipated reveals of all time
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Most anticipated has to be: Last of Us 2, FF7, THEN Cyberpunk. In my book at least"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex legends - FUN MAP
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The whole thing was of the old map. Tf ?!?!?!?! I want that shit back
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn so the gameranx ppl just 100% didn't play disco elysium I guess
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And you put best disappointing game. Let’s do some checking of your videos please. Overall good but double check your work.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,why no MMO category?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,imagine being more hype for doom eternal rather than cyperpunk 2077
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What’s the name of the mall looks familiar
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Really? Fallen order? I thought it was a kiddie dark souls with no gear or weapons.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The last of us 2 should have at least been nominated for most anticipated game god damn it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The RE2 Remake and Sekiro are fantastic games and the best of the year for me.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Of course, they're terrible compared to SUPER MARIO BROS 2 BABYYYY"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,this was actually funny
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about divinity original sin 2? :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kinda disappointing that i didn't see Astral Chain on any list. loved that game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about Red redemption 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"No background music in best narrative games list, nice touch."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Did i miss the best gameplay game??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Or there isn’t one
iRxJg2y2UqQ,bull shirt review
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i def agree star wars game of the year if this game is a tad longer its super perfect need DLC now
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Surprised Fallen Order wasn’t on best graphics
iRxJg2y2UqQ,And the game of the year is... Raid Shadow Legends
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"RE2R should at least be nominated in the best looking graphics, but oh well..."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,falcon come on - face reveal !!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Tbh I didn’t enjoy metro exodus as much as I thought but it’s ok
iRxJg2y2UqQ,alright the best style by far is the outer wilds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,EXCUSE ME!?! What about call of duty mobile???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,at least give us falcon's face reveal for 2020 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,dam disappointed
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last of Us 2 not even mentioned for most anticipated game of 2020???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern warfare? If you're talking about the modern were there on PlayStation 3 I agree but as for PS4 goes I'm glad I got my refund
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I disagreed but also wanted a falcon release. Hardest mission wasn’t even entertained with monster hunter world.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Seems like people riding kojimas nuts for goty
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Disco Elysium > Outer Worlds
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No god of war for best style or graphics? Crazy
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why can I not find what the golf??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,sekiro should’ve won tbh i loved it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait falcon is not an actual being?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,At 8:15 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,With the Jordan one obsidians though
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Nice
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game in 2020 is easily the last of us 2 in my opinion.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How do you find these mobile games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Farming simulator 19 better be on here
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Can't you give an Xbox to a person who is not from Europe, Australia, US at the last time of this year? I'm ready to get one."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control was nominated for best graphics over Days Gone gtfo ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"""2019 was an incredible year for gaming.... if you like to play BAD VIDEO GAMES"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,*Eleven
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex legends is my favorite game of 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,kind of sad The Last of Us Part 2 wasn’t on the most anticipated list
iRxJg2y2UqQ,These guys will die on the hill for days gone.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys really are more excited for Doom Eternal than Cyberpunk 2077...? Honestly also kind of surprised you didn't give Disco Elysium any love at all. Probably one of the most interesting, well written games I've played in a long time"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"KH3 Nominated for best rpg, yet also is nominated for biggest disappointment ?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly probably the worst year for gaming in the past five years. Haven’t really enjoyed anything besides fallen order
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I see pizza, I press the like button. easy."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wowowo.... where is dying light 2 at the most anticipated categories???? It should at least be up there some where right?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why was Sekiro not covered indepth? Its GOTY...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"2019 was one of the worst years for games. A few decent games maybe, but overall it sucked"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,gameranx you are entertaining af
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What's is rdr2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,doom eternal................ uh huh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This year sucked for games imo
iRxJg2y2UqQ,who else was tired of hearing the same game’s for each category?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,metro exodus should have got best narrative underated game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,01:34:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Modern Warfare best fps, best multiplayer????? HUH?!?!?!?!!?!?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is the gillie suit?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,God of war!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You should make a best games of the decade video
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where’s falcon?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about mortal kombat 11
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best sports games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lol all the top apps are only IOS
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What did pokemon not get anything
iRxJg2y2UqQ,3:43 I totally expected public nudity or something of that sort.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thanks gameranx <3 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Just one hell of a big thank you to all you guys. Ive been subscribed for years, and will check you guys out for years to come."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Big up for Control!!! Love that game so much
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Funny how I find Gameranx' GOTY more credible than the VGAs. Good job guys!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Falcon, I know what you did last summer: your tattoos. :D"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,14:09 Jake over here with freedom fighters; awesome dude
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The D2 is solid, just pick it up the ultimate edition at  80% and is being just amazing"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Lmao, did no one notice that shot at the Geeks and Gamers channel? ???"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This looks so scuffed. I love it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thank you for all the great videos you made for us this year! The before you buy videos especially helped me a lot.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Glad to see that you’ve upgraded the camera/editing gear too. Everything looks more crisp now.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i am surprised that dmc didnt win the music category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Good job on your picks, Control is my GOTY as well. Glad to see it getting much deserved recognition."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Fallout 76 doesn’t have bugs, it’s polished, it has the best interactions, and it totally doesn’t have hackers. It’s clEArly the best game"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Today I remembered Anthem was this year...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I didn’t even know Breakpoint came out lmao
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I know it didn't come out this year but battlefront 2 made one of the biggest comebacks in gaming history
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Best Music had Borderlands3 by far !!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My most anticipated game of 2020 is easily The Last of Us 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,We need a game of the decade
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Intro had me rolling. Its been a fun year with yall losers cant wait for 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love how you guy have a balance between screen time and narratives...good work gentlemen!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"surprising how a platinum title like astral chain was overlooked since it was released, Is the game bad? its highly reviewed so I don't feel that it was. so what makes it forgettable compare to other not as glamours games like days gone? I would appreciate any insight on the matter."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WHAAAT THE F!!! WHY DID YOU NOT MENTION FORTNITE!!!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Happy New Year, Boys and Falcon!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,i wonder how much time did u spend on finding all those random places to film
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love how random this video is
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro exodus didn't get enough love at all...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Borderlands 3 best music, easily"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Only game worthy of an award is Outer Wilds. Dont @ me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"SERIOUSLY?? NO RACING CATEGORY? DIDN'T EXPECT THIS FROM FALCON, AT LEAST. WHY'S NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS?!!!!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love the choice of Apex!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,tom rockin the trav 1 high lookin sty!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Falcon has the best commentary!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,heck yeah fallen order is amazing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What's with the purple gloves? I totally get the normal hotdog suit but random purple gloves?!?! 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Also jedi fallen order seemed to be nominated for every category.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer Worlds??!! Good but not great. Disco Elysium had some brilliance.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Breakpoint was a massive let down for me
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Why is falcon never on screen, I've always pictured him Looking kinda like Jake"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So Last of Us 2 wasn’t taken into consideration?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Disco Elysium wasn't in indie category?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,list is fine but seriously gameranx doom before final fantasy remake and cyberpunk?? I see crack has also made its way to your studio
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Congrats guys for #34 trending !!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Notice the contrast between the empty malls and out of business stores? People are staying home too much and the real economy is gone
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think half life alyx should be in the most anticipated category
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern Warfare multiplayer isn't great they literally designed the game to appeal to campers
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No RE3 for most anticipated?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Disco Elysium highly underrated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Anyone agree kingdom hearts 3 should’ve been nominated for best RPG? I can see why it was a bit of a disappointment for:
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Some questions never answered
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Revealing more questions that were never answered and we KH fans have to wait for kingdom hearts 4
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No man's sky for game of the year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,channel of the year. gg gameranx
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I always watch your videos but this one really was bad.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Disco Elysium should have won rpg.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Aurora legends  is something  I got into
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Can you guys do top 10 games of the decade?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why did you not include the last of us 2 for the most anticipated game of 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control Coming August 2020
iRxJg2y2UqQ, ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,or is it already out on console I assume
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Days Gone should have at least been nominated for best music. Terrific score in that game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Jedi fallen order wasn’t a nominee for bets music? Wut?!?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"How is the last of us 2 not even mentioned in most anticipated game of 2020, if you took an internet poll I’m sure that would be in the top 2... and it’s not even mentioned ?????"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WHERES OUR PIZZA?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I would have said sekiro for action adventure but both RE2 and Jedi Fallen Badboi are both legit
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"It’s crazy seeing how much this channel and the great people behind it have grown. More or less I’ve been here since the early day’s when I was a sophomore in college while now I’ve graduated with a great career, married, and a baby. What a wonderful experience to have shared with this channel. Hope everyone has a happy new year."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow they take hard drugs to make control game of the year. Wtf
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"My only thing with jedi fallen order is  that it wasn’t long enough, but maybe that’s how you know it’s good"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Yo have convinced me to buy control
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Walking simulator got best open world game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Warframe where is it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Pokemon not even in most disappointed list??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No anime game. Nani
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro exodus is too underrated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,your picks for most anticipated games is awful
iRxJg2y2UqQ,FALCON PUNCH!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I have a sudden urge to eat hotdogs
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RE2 action adventure?  Uh...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Survival horror?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Community votes.....suk
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What a cringe fest...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Snooze stranding
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro deserved more...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2020: Ori 2
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You put the division 2 in your top t'en WORST games i dont get it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Pretty much the only 2019 games I've actually played are Rage 2 which has some serious single player flaws, and Link's Awakening which really doesn't hold your hanf"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Nice award show gameranx.  I think once Ubisoft stops doing the 3rd person view for Ghost Recon games and go back to 1st person like it originally was we’ll actually have a fun and satisfying Ghost Recon.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Cool video man!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most disappointing game Is fallout 76
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This is a better... much shorter. Game awards...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The production value is bad, but pretty solid nominations and winners."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So that’s what’s inside a hotdog.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m loving ghost recon breakpoint
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Who is scared of the thumbnail like me?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Most disappointing game, rage 2 should not have been a nominee. Rage 2 was actually a good game."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"BEST FPS GAMES its a lie what bout cs go and cs s what about other games u real made this list like in 3 mins cuz u are repeating games and most of them arent GOOD and dude u just put 3 games in ""BEST FPS"" dude its like the opposite"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,litteraly its the worst fps cuz u can put some work in to ur list m8s rly.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys should have Best Mobile game to Best APPLE mobile game........
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Android wtf?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,where was the worst game of the year category? I wanted you guys to show of wrestling 2k20
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Am I the only one who is excited for halo infinite
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is Super Mario Bros 2?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is KH3 really that bad. I haven't played it yet but was really excited to finish the story arch. The reviews I've seen have been so mixed tho that I'm not sure if it's worth the playthrough because some people say it's great & some say a complete let down. Can someone who actually played it give me some feedback please ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro......Seccerow?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Were´s the sekiro love
iRxJg2y2UqQ,yes to 2020!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2019 was a good year if you like shitty games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where’s outerorlds man they made fallout new Vegas 2 with little to now bugs
iRxJg2y2UqQ,great video guys as always even though i disagree with most choices :P
iRxJg2y2UqQ,So glad you guys left the ending scene in there. Hilarious!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The division 2 was so disappointing for me. I loved the first game but they changed things that didn't need changes.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Destiny in best FPS. Most of the Time im in third Person while playing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Andrew, Jake, and Tom all comin thru with the heat on their feet in this video"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Great video guys, excited to see what you all amongst the rest have instore for consummers and fans in 2020!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"For me it was Borderlands 3, I waited many many years... Still have so much left to play. Also, I think FH4 had alot of exciting stuff this year, the past few months I really got into it and progressed the most in this game out of them all, even the OG Motorsports titles."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thank you for all the contet you put up for us this year!!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Now please get some rest for 2020 you guys deserve it. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Take care and we gamers wish you a happy 2020.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait is that the sun vet mall?? i feel like the only thing keeping that place open is the pizza place in there lol
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This legit was such a weird yet satisfying video to watch.. I'm confused..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,14:18 why can't i have stores like that in my city!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Pizza Really Is On You This Time Jake!! ???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jake ma man, you're a gift from god"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Big congrats to star wars!! Currently about 10 hours in and have to say I love it!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I never want to see Jake's legs again
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Damn Air Jordan 1 Travis Scott's!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why do you own a Ghillie suit?! xD
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lol wtf Doom and not final fantasy 7 ?? Guys thats why u could not do crack
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where’s Breath of the Wild
iRxJg2y2UqQ,THANK YOU for not padding the video with a bunch of nonsense talking.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about raid shadow legends? I mean EVERYBODY is talking about it ALL THE TIME
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Mall... just casually records a video in an unsecured mall
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Anticipated games what about the last of us
iRxJg2y2UqQ,5.4 million subscribers as of this comment- and you deserve everyone of them. Great job guys- here's to more in the new year...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Modern Warfare wins best multiplayer...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,If there's any doubt gamers are uninformed about what happens in gaming it's this right here...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Resident Evil 2 remake nom for best graphics? That game looks amazing in 4k
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I wish I was as Handsome as Jake Baldino
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No half life alyx in most anticipated games of 2020?????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Not a single award for DMC 5... Extremely sad but it's alright. Still loved the video anyway ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Nice face Falcon I always thought you had a big head
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What's your best VR game of the year?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,best sports game!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No last of us 2 for most anticipated game? How?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Woo hoo can't wait till 2020 ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Funny how one of the guys who worked on new Vegas just 9-10 years ago was one of the main devs of the Outer Worlds, which I love"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Phenomenally done year wrap up. Here's to more Gameranx in 2020. Shout out what your most hyped for in the coming year. For me it is: Resident Evil 3 Remake.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No last of Us for most anticipated!?!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Outer Worlds best RPG? What exactly is so good about this game? Two choices per quest? 3 endings where one is the 'special'/hidden? It was a well made game but there was very little RPG about it.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"All those nominations for best looking game are grey, muddy and uninspiring"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Happy Division 2 got mentioned
iRxJg2y2UqQ,God of War wasn't anywhere on here though?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Best free mobile game is Cardinal Quest 2, it’s a beautiful nostalgic roguelike"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Doom is the most anticipated game? Wtf!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Nobody cares about Doom when you have Cyberpunk and FF7 coming up
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Breakpoint was a huge disappointment
iRxJg2y2UqQ,wtf no last of us part 2 on most anticipated???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No mention of ffxiv for anything hmm. Last of us 2? Shenmue 3?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is Falcon the guy with the tattoos?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is the last of us 2 not one of the most anticipated games of 2020?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ik people don’t like gears 5 but it had an amazing story and should have been at least nominated
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why was re2 and jedi fallen order nit nominated for best graphics they were so incredible.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about far Cry New Dawn
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You forgot about Fallout 76 for disappointing game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Idk why Metro Exodus is a option for best anything. I got the game when it first release on my Xbox X and the input lag was horrendous. I couldn't even get past the first mission and heard it only works well on PC which sucks cause I was looking forward to it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The games in the most disappointing games category makes me sad. Out of the games in that category the racing game is the only one I don't care for. The rest I've either loved or want to love, but haven't played yet. I hope they can turn themselves around either through reworking the game (like Anthem supposedly is doing) or through DLC."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about VR games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Outer Worlds was not a better RPG than Greedfall. Change My Mind.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Are outlanders and bleak sword only on iOS?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Does anyone know what falcon looks like?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Borderlands 3 for open world game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why is follout 76 not here Wtf man
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What's wrong with Geeks and Gamers?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Dangerous Driving Is A Burnout Rip-off.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait wait wait there is phone games but not vr games f off
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys should have a podcast
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why does jake look like will cooper from single parents
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Tom at 9:45?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Rage 2 is apparently a lot like Rage 1 in that I appear to be the only that really enjoyed it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It was definitely Fire Emblem Three Houses all the way for me this year
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Out of all the games listed here the biggest disappointment imo is KH3.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Quite an interesting video
iRxJg2y2UqQ,sekiro is not the game of the year because people voting for other games hasnt got past lady butterfly yet
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is racing game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is baba is you?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Who plays cod ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love your videos usually. But you missed some big hitters in this one. 
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"2020 - The last of us part 2, is the most anticipated. Probably closely followed by Cyberpunk."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Surprised that Disco Elysium isnt there, it should be there is most categories. Guess the console plebs didnt play it.. i guess they prefer to carry a pizza and walk hours in a boring world with a boring story lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,sekiro?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Fallen Order should have definetly won best style
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Was kinda  hoping R6 could get best shooter
iRxJg2y2UqQ,how tf is resident evil 2 not even a nominee for best graphics......
iRxJg2y2UqQ,CALL OF DUTY: MORDERN WARFARE
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I don't like Battle Royal at all. I prefer the more classic and traditional deathmatch
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think fallout 76 should’ve made nominee for disappointing games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex wasn't nominated for game of the year? WTF
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Honestly, I would pick Rage 2 as the most disappointing game.  I didn't expect Anthem to be good.  Rage 2 looked amazing in the gameplay previews, and it was amazing for the first 2-3 hours.  Like an open world Doom.  I was so underwhelmed by rage 2 i uninstalled it after 3 days and havent ever gone back.  The combat is good but the open world filler that makes up 80% of the game is just awful."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,was hoping to see falcon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,1. MINECRAFT 1.15
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2. MINECRAFT 1.14
iRxJg2y2UqQ,...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,69. Super smash bro’s
iRxJg2y2UqQ,>best music
iRxJg2y2UqQ,>doesn't play any music
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Do best games of the decade
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This was more exciting than watching The Game Awards 2019
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love the video guys
iRxJg2y2UqQ,KH3  RAGE 2 GET REAL
iRxJg2y2UqQ,2019 video games were trash tbh
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"You guys are more excited about Doom? Dude..... When Cyberpunk 2077 comes out, I am quitting my job and eating on my 401K until there is nothing left........."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,plague tale innocence should have won best indie game
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Thanks for nominating Breakpoint for the worst game. Totally deserves it. Like people decided to convert tactical and somewhat realistic (first one was!) series of games into looter-shooter with tier system and levels and grind etc. It's not an AC game where it worked very well..
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Lack of variety of games this year :/
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"they need to stop saying Days gone story went on too long because that's what makes me love those games, makes it worth buying it and to be honest it wasn't that long at all"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Apex isn't respawn at their best. ? Titanfall 2 is respawn at their best.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I feel like luigis mandion 3 deserves some more love.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Thank you for the effort of making this very entertaining. I can't imagine the BTS of when Jake went inside the garbage thingy (cant remember whats it called) and went behind the bushes, and went up the tree, and wore the hotdog costume. It must have been tough but you did it for us! Thank you! Cheers to another year for Gameranx!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,HEY THERE GEEKS no-no I'll never do it like that.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Metro Exodus is definitely underrated, the story was pretty damn good among other things."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,WE NEED BEST GAMES OF THE DECADEE
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"17:22 Tom just casually wearing $1,500 Travis Jordan 1's lmfaooo"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,21:10 it's the mold in the power armor that got him.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,At the end of the video I was left with the impression that only 7 games were nominated for all the categories.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Good choices for picks for sure very glad you guys gave Days Gone some credit for the open world category. In my opinion it just wasn't looked at enough for the things it did get right and it is still something new for Bend Studio. They're just getting their feet wet but I believe more and better games will come from them...... Syphon Filter??????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Honestly I was expecting Plage Tale at the narrative... that game got me sitting in front of YT longplay like an anvil at my ankle...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Right now at BW office ""yeah! We have won an award!!!"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You forgot to add a game GTFO best selling steam game rn and it’s heavily team based making it fun as hell
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Eastshade and Farming Simulator 19!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The fact that he had Freedom Fighters in his hand for the best style game made me so happy!!! ? anyone else?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"come on gameranx , when are we gonna get a falcon face reveal?"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"How did kingdom hearts 3 not make best sound track/music. Its one of the few things the game is stunningly. For me dmc5 and,kh3 were top 2 for,music"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Im starting to think that falcon is an ACTUAL FALCON
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why every time you talked about fallen order i got star Wars fallen order ads
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My Most Anticipated game is The Last of Us 2. Im kinda sad that it isnt on the list :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,My Indie GOTY has to be River City Girls from WayForward.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Damn I feel bad for DMC5, it was nominated a lot, but didn't win anything, I really really love the gameplay, style and music"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:30 Just keep clicking and keep laughing! ?????? Happy 2020 everyone! ????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Host of the year goes to........
iRxJg2y2UqQ,OMG it's Falcon. Congratulations Falcon.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,OMG IM NOT ALONE IN MY FALLEN ORDER LOVE
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"So no one played Katana Zero and ""Haha funny goose"" won over it. I am LIVID"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I’m glad the division got mentioned
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think fallen order had some great music deserved at least a nomination I mean it really gave me some original trilogy feels
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I like this lol if you all started getting twisted and doing this I'm ok with it. Do more of this
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Kudos for including mobile gaming.. But I can't seem to find them. IOS only? Control! ? Star wars! ? Now I'm even more hyped to get them
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Most anticipated game for 2020...last of us 2??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,w-what abou pizza tower? :(
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why didn't you do best 'Coop' game in the chicken coop?! Missed opportunity.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"WWE 2K20 for best looking game of the year, and game of the year ???"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow I never new I would try the Star Wars games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Awesome video, but U really be sleeping on Metro Exodus"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wait a new animal crossing game coming soon
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Oh heck yeah
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"The hotdog birth at the end was the proverbial cherry on top lolol. Have a great New year guys I love your channel, keep it up!!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Award Goes To....
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Jedi fallen order soundtrack? didn't even get mentioned, that shit hits hard and it's like an original film one"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I can't find any of the mobile games on play store or apk pure
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Love Jake
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That pizza looked hella good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,why are you standing in the middle of the mall haha
iRxJg2y2UqQ,East end gaming wow..my neck of the woods
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You nominate DMC instead of RE2 for graphics??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,That was entertaining guys.. And all wins made sense. Good job
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Frickin why is the last of us 2 not on the most anticipated of 2020 list
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control is definitely amazing. It's just so fun. I don't get why Sekiro is winning all the awards to be honest. I got bored of it really quickly. Great jobs dudes
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Star war for game of the year i didn't see that coming
iRxJg2y2UqQ,How about watch dog legion?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is our friday ep?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"they  slayed Sekiro, 2 nominees."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,...and the Oscar goes to...
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I think RDR 2 was also a good looking game.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Last of Us 2 not a nominee for most anticipated game of 2020? GTFOOH!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where’s the dude who does the narrating then?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"all of them mobile games are ios, no android? i looked in the play store for them, not a well balanced awards, could of done seperate ones for ios and android"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The battle royaleness
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"i disappointed  with Anthem, but i enjoy play the game."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The more I see jake baldino the happier I get
iRxJg2y2UqQ,4:58 waittttt thats our hero FALCON
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about best game of the decade?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,It was just me I voted 30000 times
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RAGE 2 was awesome
iRxJg2y2UqQ,HeY Wh3Re aRe tHe FRee To pLaY GaiMs ?!?!?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wtf where's last of us 2 for a 2020 game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I kinda hoped for RDR2 Pc
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Its been a really bad year for games
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where was kh3 for music bro
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Game of the decade awards please
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Metro Exodus should get more awards
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Ok but game of the year should go to super Mario bros. 2 though
iRxJg2y2UqQ,will there be a worst game of the year award
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Really? More excited for what is going to be a run of the mill game with Doom more so than Cyberpunk?? Were you guessing at what you’re anticipated for? Lost me there.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Hellblade? It's graphics are rlly good
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where are the racing games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Face reveal for falcon after the decade??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Surely bl3 counts as an rpg
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm sorry but how couldn't The Last of Us Part 2 not even be metioned in the most anticipated games?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No raid shadow legends !!!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The Last of Us 2 is supposed to release in 2020. How did that not get nominated? The original was one of the most powerfully emotional videogames I've ever played.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,None of the mobile games are on android???
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Why not the best sports Game?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Best Game Awards Ceremony
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I know it's been mentioned but how on earth does The Last of Us Part 2 not make the 'Most Anticipated Game' list? It's pretty much the most anticipated game of the past few years. Of the decade, maybe! Pretty big oversight guys! Cray cray."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,What about flying gorilla????
iRxJg2y2UqQ,did none of you play Disco Elysium????   Also how Outer Worlds gets best RPG is beyond me...it does less things than New Vegas...the open worlds might as well be smallish open levels and it just didnt expand on the genre..very vanilla...nice tasty vanilla but same ole.... it would be nice if games which try and succeed at new stuff got recognized for it
iRxJg2y2UqQ,? My OUTER WORLDS™ Dumb Dialog PlayThru easily made it my GOTY ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This whole vid was a meme.. ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Wow sekiro got nothing
iRxJg2y2UqQ,While I understand why anthem was chosen as most disappointing I also don't know why. There was never a second where I thought that game was going to be great or even good. People shouldn't have been disappointed they should've been ready for it being a failure
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Notttt the jssssssss ??
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I lost interest in Jedi Fallen Order after the first couple of levels due to the repetitive Gameplay elements. Don't get me wrong though, I'm sure it's a good game and I do think it should be Highly Praised for not being a Macro Transaction filled ? machine.   Other Publishers should Learn from it's Success."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,RDR2 should of been somewhere haha
iRxJg2y2UqQ,DAYS G O N E
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Fallen order would have been a masterpiece if the exploration rewards were not 99% cosmetic... EA for ya tho. I mean, how hard would it have been to say:"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Noice NECKburd gamer
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Sekiro?!?!?!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Control was good and probably was one of the better choices for 2019 but this year's choices weren't very impressive honestly. Do you think developers are holding back for next year console releases?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You realise Call of Duty Mobile came out this year right?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,You guys really didnt like borderlands 3 huh?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I'm surprised Wolfenstein Youngblood was not featured under most disappointing.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,This goes out to every gamer who has a regular job processing orders at some company and would love to work in an office like yours... Happy new year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,20:11 Well there goes some single use plastic.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Imagine if they put just dance in every year.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"17:18 missed opportunity, should have worn a pizza costume instead lol"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,8:13 I thought he hung himself
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I really like the scenes of the video.
iRxJg2y2UqQ,No Gears 5? That gsme looked and played amazeing and the story was also very good (if you follow the gears story from the beginning)
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Honestly who every sees this comment should play ""my friend pedro"""
iRxJg2y2UqQ,REALLY.... The last of us 2 not being in most anticipated!? Pfffft
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Gameranx is my favourite Channel, subbed for years & I love it."
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"Deep down, maybe hidden in a tiny dusty box, we are all know that the new animal crossing is the most exciting game coming in 2020"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"I love what you guys did with the transitions, real fresh!"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,11:37:00 AM
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Where is Jump Force
iRxJg2y2UqQ,The end part was hilarious
iRxJg2y2UqQ,"So happy apex got nominated for more than 2 things. It's been my favourite game this year, and really  fun"
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I thought that Jedi Fallen Order had some pretty kickass graphics
iRxJg2y2UqQ,7:08 is cute
iRxJg2y2UqQ,Is Falcon a real human being? Every video makes me doubt a little more!
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I love your style keep it up guys ?
iRxJg2y2UqQ,I litterly said best open world will be Deth Stranding or Days gone. Got it 
jJkNHCTGN1w,We need all celebrations(only cool ones)
jJkNHCTGN1w,Am I the only one who misses the practice arena from fifa 12?
jJkNHCTGN1w,“Everything else is completely new” every fifa every year is the same lmao
jJkNHCTGN1w,wow... EA is so lucky. Wish I can submit the same uni assignment every year by only changing the font and few words.
jJkNHCTGN1w,It literally looks and plays the same. Same set ups and everything
jJkNHCTGN1w,2:33 on the left of neymars head you see jose mourinho?
jJkNHCTGN1w,You know he plays a lot when he notices handshake variations.
jJkNHCTGN1w,"This game ain't quite Pes 2020, the gameplay is 3 years behind, its like ping pong with tricks."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Where is the new gameplay??
jJkNHCTGN1w,"You are not completely honest, you work for FIFA."
jJkNHCTGN1w,this whole video is just Matt talking about this skill move...
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Real ones know that laying the ball off increases accuracy of the shot,pass or cross in real life. Sorry Matt thats an L from you."
jJkNHCTGN1w,I remember in fifa 07 when nobody would even consider being man city
jJkNHCTGN1w,"You are incorrect, setting up the shot or a cross with a touch absolutely improves accuracy, power and trajectory. I am surprised you say that as someone that plays."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is there actually any noticeable difference in gameplay? Lol looks exactly the same as FIFA 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Laying off the ball increases the ball accuarcy imo
jJkNHCTGN1w,Edit: yo wtf. Why did u unpin me
jJkNHCTGN1w,looks like ping pong. great?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The ball physics in FIFA are actually so poor, looks like a giant ice puck flying about"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"""These are all kits, everything else is new"""
jJkNHCTGN1w,Look at the ratings! I really hope they are old ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,When someone says that FIFA hasn’t changed visually because it has reached “peak graphics” for this console generation and not because they’ve used the same engine for every game for the past 4 years...?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Nobody:
jJkNHCTGN1w,Absolutely Nobody:
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt: WOW that’s incredible absolutely fantastic
jJkNHCTGN1w,"RIP Martin Tyler and Alan Smith, they will be missed"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Ping Pong 20!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks utterly crap
jJkNHCTGN1w,"""Realistic gameplay"""
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Kompany layed off the ball then layed a rocket into the net against Leicester, you sir are wrong, I'm sorry."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can someone count how many times matt talked about the 'advanced layoff'???
jJkNHCTGN1w,3:59 that ball roll into a pass looked very smooth
jJkNHCTGN1w,FIFA 20 NEW FEATURE : ‘varied handshakes’ ????
jJkNHCTGN1w,“The handshakes look good”
jJkNHCTGN1w,INNOVATION
jJkNHCTGN1w,In that replay of mane. His posture and style of dribbling looked exactly how he would in real life.
jJkNHCTGN1w,I only bought FIFA 20 because of the Dutch commentator El Sierd
jJkNHCTGN1w,04:06:00 AM
jJkNHCTGN1w,FFS EA! Why is Van Dijk Moving away from the ball
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt have you got an issue clearly stating the negatives that need improving and the positives jesus christ all your doing is rambling non stop!!!!!!! honest and straight up??? your literally overthinking everything you say so you don't upset your EA GOD'S!!!!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,this video could easily have been 6 minutes. matt prolonged it with “well”s and “absolutely”s
jJkNHCTGN1w,It does increase your accuracy the momentum it has going makes it faster and more accurate when you hit it right  and moving like that sets it up for a way better shot
jJkNHCTGN1w,Finally new commentators!!! Not only for the Champions League.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Myth: there's only 3 players with over 99 in game stats
jJkNHCTGN1w,New drinking game: have a shot every time Matt says lay-off
jJkNHCTGN1w,5:18 - I see the tackling is still atrocious
jJkNHCTGN1w,"""you know how I told you about that new skill move?"" Yes Matt, that's the only thing you talked about"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I think the lay off touch can  increase accuracy as you are composing yourself, perfect example last night with Ruben Neves vs United"
jJkNHCTGN1w,10:44 the Fans got Great again ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"25:42,goalkeeper still wont come out,figures."
jJkNHCTGN1w,FIFA MYTH:
jJkNHCTGN1w,Kai havertz has 4 star weak foot on career mode but in ultimate team he has 5 star weak foot
jJkNHCTGN1w,15:26 I really like how the players react on that second yellow for Matip. Who else agrees?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I think the crowd has changed like when u score a goal they move a lot more
jJkNHCTGN1w,2 HEADER GOALS :/ ffs... crosses are still op... dont like that
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Can you do FIFA 19 vs FIFA 20. Comparing passes, shooting, build up ext."
jJkNHCTGN1w,12:08:00 AM
jJkNHCTGN1w,[Arsenal fans did not like that]
jJkNHCTGN1w,Selling Sterling bad advice because of squad builders. If he's that good already and you can get a better version...
jJkNHCTGN1w,guys i’m definitely buying the game cause wow we have new handshakes pre game ??
jJkNHCTGN1w,"4:10 , new shoot animation"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"2:00 ""The handshakes are better"" FIFA 20 GAMEPLAY"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can you do the “lay-off touch” whilst sprinting?
jJkNHCTGN1w,So impressive when van dijk at 4.06 runs away from defending.
jJkNHCTGN1w,IRL when you use the layoff it provides more space giving you  more time so i would guess it increases accuracy
jJkNHCTGN1w,Volta + New Celebrations
jJkNHCTGN1w,That's all/
jJkNHCTGN1w,Expectation: real life
jJkNHCTGN1w,Reality: fifa 18.3
jJkNHCTGN1w,THE UMTITI CELEBRATION YESSS
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Dang it looks good, it looks like FIFA 19, but something is a bit different, the uniforms maybe, not sure."
jJkNHCTGN1w,The amount of likes this has is the amount of bourbon packs Matt’s opened
jJkNHCTGN1w,12:48 “yao feelix”..... why can like 5% of fifa youtubers pronounce João Félix?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I play pro football and i think when you do this skill move jn real life it really differs the shot will be better if you lay it of
jJkNHCTGN1w,Tutorials on all the op skills and shooting techniques
jJkNHCTGN1w,A set up touch 100% improves your accuracy in real life
jJkNHCTGN1w,Honestly I only play career mode n if it didn’t have the new look for  broadcast I would think ur playin fifa 19 but idk maybe if ur playin it’s different
jJkNHCTGN1w,Its just the same every year im sick of it
jJkNHCTGN1w,@matthdgamer João Felix is Portuguese pronounce the J when you say his name.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Also any skill move that increases cross or shot accuracy should get nerfed. We don’t need el tornado crosses again in fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,4:15 you ll never ever see that happen irl again
jJkNHCTGN1w,commentary is a tad out of sync i reckon
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Hey Matt, have they fixed the goals straight from kick-off??"
jJkNHCTGN1w,How about let people wait and actually enjoy the game when they get it
jJkNHCTGN1w,Maybe 5* skills with full skill execution ability.
jJkNHCTGN1w,4 * -> 80%
jJkNHCTGN1w,so on...
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is timed finishing still in the game
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I can't tell the difference, it looks the same fifa19 fifa18 etc..."
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 20 graphics looks exactly the same as fifa 98, I'm disappointed?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,They still haven’t fixed firminos wack model
jJkNHCTGN1w,NOTHING CHANGE. INCREDIBLE.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Rumour has it that Matt is still talking about the new skill move.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Graphical fine tuning?!? You mean the cardboard cut audiences with static waving of the “wooden” flags and banners?!?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Nobody :
jJkNHCTGN1w,Absolutely nobody :
jJkNHCTGN1w,Me : Umtiti celebration ??
jJkNHCTGN1w,My first impression - much better TV broadcast scoreboard in top left side of the screen.
jJkNHCTGN1w,imagine bobby firmino and that new skill move when the finnese meta was a thing
jJkNHCTGN1w,please do Volta story and the pic is my mom so don't wonder why a grown women is watching videos about fifa
jJkNHCTGN1w,The animations and the celebrations are very different and the field as well
jJkNHCTGN1w,This literally looks like a slower version of 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,3:10-3:15 u said something bad bout EA then you remembered they give you pack luck and rig your account so you edit it out
jJkNHCTGN1w,You can do some good moves. But for the love of God pass the ball. I had a hard time watching this game play.
jJkNHCTGN1w,I feel like they sould slow the time down for fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Laying the ball off SHOULD increase shot or cross accuracy IMO 
jJkNHCTGN1w,I like the idea behind the mechanic
jJkNHCTGN1w,You can take advantage of having more time and space on the ball
jJkNHCTGN1w,When Matt talks it feels like your girlfriend telling you a story
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 19 with different color scheme
jJkNHCTGN1w,heres how many times he said new layoff skill move 
jJkNHCTGN1w,?
jJkNHCTGN1w,16:55 that's a rebound right there
jJkNHCTGN1w,??!
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The players look like they move a lot heavier like in real life, looks good"
jJkNHCTGN1w,I'M buying Pes 2020.It will be a good decision
jJkNHCTGN1w,"That skills you do early of the game, pes18 already have ?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Everyone - JUST SHOW US EVERYTHING FFS?
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks a bit tactically could do with speeding it up
jJkNHCTGN1w,The lay off touch I believe it does work in real life cuz it always works for me as in getting it on target more
jJkNHCTGN1w,Dude why are your videos 720p its 2019 man?!
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The audience needs updating, they have been the same since fifa 13, don't understand why there isn't stewards separating the home team from the away team, just really unrealistic, also in derbies the crowd should be louder etc."
jJkNHCTGN1w,My God.. Can you speak less of the *advanced ball roll*?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Bloody EA, looks exactly like Fifa 19."
jJkNHCTGN1w,the layoff is them setting themselves up for the shot or cross instead of having it be so sudden how could it not improve the shot or cross.
jJkNHCTGN1w,This just looks like fifa 19 ffs...it'll be my last one if it plays like it.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Get some pro clubs content heard they brought new things!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,and every second person in the crowd still looks the same lmao
jJkNHCTGN1w,anyone hyped for fifa 20 career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa myth for you here Matt, no one has ever got a walk out in the first pack they open on ultimate team (obviously after the starter pack)."
jJkNHCTGN1w,I'm footballer and layoff the ball really helps
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Any new dive moves for Neymar, Kane and Ramos?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,It litterely look exactly the same.
jJkNHCTGN1w,I play alot of fifa and I can see a clear difference with this fifa
jJkNHCTGN1w,It does that just shows you’ve never played in real life ?? if you lay it of it give u more power and can increase your accuracy
jJkNHCTGN1w,I can tell a difference. It looks smoother.
jJkNHCTGN1w,2 goals from headers where defenders were also contesting. Smh
jJkNHCTGN1w,I like that when Matt say defending is great you see Robertson ai blocking two shot at a row
jJkNHCTGN1w,the whole point of a layoff is so that the ball isnt at your feet making the shot easier...and more accurate
jJkNHCTGN1w,myth : can you play with Alex Hunter in Volta?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I disagree with you. I think the Salah scored Chelsea with that technique.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wow this gameplay looks so good and different what we see before in videos ..  I hope fifa 20 will be good..
jJkNHCTGN1w,Been waiting on this for a long time
jJkNHCTGN1w,Myth: can you dive
jJkNHCTGN1w,It's actually good that the Gameplay feels way slower!. Makes the game more realistic!
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Its also great that Skill Moves are not op anymore, now u have Volta for that Sh*t...."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Im so happy that Messi actually Will be usefull in this FIFA!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wow fifa 18 looking special 
jJkNHCTGN1w,OH WAIT
jJkNHCTGN1w,I want a video thats you show all the new stuff in FIFA 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Its kick off gameplay, ultimate team gameplay is different so I dont care this ?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,There’s no new player faces smh
jJkNHCTGN1w,I’ve always wanted that skill that was done by son in this game
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Matts definitely got Autism. ""In my opinion"" (of course)."
jJkNHCTGN1w,The mechanics look almost the same as PES.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why are not the goalkeeper gloves as in PES20? Looks like winter gloves.?
jJkNHCTGN1w,It's exhausting how much you mention that new skill move :P
jJkNHCTGN1w,I play a lot of fifa and I can’t really see any different in gameplay
jJkNHCTGN1w,"God i hope the ball physics have changed. Fif 19 Done my head in, every shot had back-spin or was a cut across. That added with the fact that when they added the timed finishing patch they also made finesse shots virtually unusable."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Edit: Bring back fifa 14 shot physics pls
jJkNHCTGN1w,"so, the finished timed shot is still there"
jJkNHCTGN1w,skil move Erro = RNG! just call it RNG damm it!
jJkNHCTGN1w,I really wanna see the timed defending...
jJkNHCTGN1w,I heard your voice and I was thinking where I have heard it and I knew it was you bcz I see you on Facebook reviews a lot and that's you. Doing good job bro
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Graphics still the same, they can´t fix the gameplay and improve graphics, it´s the end of Fifa, they can´t go further"
jJkNHCTGN1w,God you blabber on! Could get a job in an OAP home the amount you carry on! ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks good than others people posting it. I like the ball physic and slow game play.
jJkNHCTGN1w,"my first instinct was that the layoff multiplyer makes sense, when I think about how I play. I often naturally knock the ball a little forward before hitting a cross. But on the flip side, only when hitting the ball from a very slow dribble/stationary. I also would be worried on how often its used."
jJkNHCTGN1w,"This year pes 20 i will buy,,fifa always the same moves,pes looks so real"
jJkNHCTGN1w,That Son skill move is OP
jJkNHCTGN1w,When are the new ratings coming out
jJkNHCTGN1w,When you do the layoff it tees the ball up for you like in real life
jJkNHCTGN1w,They still have the strange 2 lines in the grass below the center circle 3:20
jJkNHCTGN1w,How do you do that move when firmino scores?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Sorry Matt but i hardly disagree with you this time !. 
jJkNHCTGN1w,All the new mechanics make the game more realistic and less like arcade ??.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Will the kits be new when the game comes out
jJkNHCTGN1w,Am I only one here that thinks that EA changed the way that the net bulges? :/
jJkNHCTGN1w,The shooting animations look gorgeous
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Why laying off the ball and making it more accurate is unrealistic, but chaining skill moves isn't?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"FIFA MYTH: You cant get a full team with players that wear something on the head (yashin cap, peter chech head protection etc)"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Theres literally no difference from the last fifa
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay looks so much better and the animations as well I'm so hyped for this game
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is he being held hostage?
jJkNHCTGN1w,It’s the same thing as FIFA 19 lmao ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I just hope this doesn’t become the new meta
jJkNHCTGN1w,i am so glad they added the new boots 
jJkNHCTGN1w,finallyyyyyy
jJkNHCTGN1w,07:09 see the ball 
jJkNHCTGN1w,New ball physics
jJkNHCTGN1w,This could be a good skill move 
jJkNHCTGN1w,then see that verratti does the layoff and put in top bins with his weak foot
jJkNHCTGN1w,"""They've reached their limits in terms of graphics for PS4 & XBOX ONE."" Yeap, PES 19 & 20 are on PS5 and XBOX TWO after all isn't it."
jJkNHCTGN1w,"1:45 superior pc race, where we all at"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"are these overalls final or are they still being updated? Pretty sure they're still being updated, no way mane, salah etc are still 88/87"
jJkNHCTGN1w,I think the skill moves error should be down on the players dribbling and composure
jJkNHCTGN1w,wow they actually got new fans at the game
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Lemme guess you didn’t get the beta code, I got lucky for 2 years in a row"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"you need a script dude, a lot of rambling and repeating"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Laying yourself off gives you more composure so the shot being more accurate makes sense
jJkNHCTGN1w,How looks so different ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why hasn’t origi got a player face??????
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why don’t you just marry the “advanced lay-off”
jJkNHCTGN1w,I honestly can’t see any difference between this and Fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,"How are 1 on 1’s against the keeper, are they more consistent for the attack now, or are you seeing balls fly wide with no pressure"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Spurs team attack 89,  Liverpool 85 ? , man city  85 , LOL  fifa improve alot ????"
jJkNHCTGN1w,In real life if you take a golden touch it 100% helps accuracy
jJkNHCTGN1w,If it wasn’t for the lay off skill I wouldn’t know this is fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,New skill moves! I'm a really good skiller.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just joined YouTube uploading and done my first few clips.... Any tips???
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt is that the new scoreboard and graphics for the kick off matches?! They look so much cleaner and better!
jJkNHCTGN1w,I’m happy for the change of defending because I’m a great manual defender
jJkNHCTGN1w,27 mins review about skill moves...
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Laying the ball off should increase accuracy and power, STFU."
jJkNHCTGN1w,They could make it so for the skill moves that the lower the skill moves the higher the amount of errors from chaining skills
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 20 looks so bad, everything is slow"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hey Matt 
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please show us all the new celebrations in your next vid.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please talk about the new ball physics and your feelings about them.
jJkNHCTGN1w,How is the timed finishing in FIFA 20?is it still  overpowered like in FIFA 19?
jJkNHCTGN1w,omg the crowd atmosphere celebrations are lit
jJkNHCTGN1w,This guy sounds like Michael Bisping.
jJkNHCTGN1w,On the subject of the lay off skill a lot of players actually do sets themselves in real life I actually quite like it
jJkNHCTGN1w,What is that lineup from PSG?
jJkNHCTGN1w,When are the ratings released
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Oh, thought it was FIFA 19.5"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Guys did u know he’s got 7 hours of content available
jJkNHCTGN1w,fifa19?? ???
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt can you be honest and is there DDA type weird things going on in fifa 20? In your humble opinion.
jJkNHCTGN1w,We wanna see all the new skills and the new celebrations
jJkNHCTGN1w,all skill moves and new celebrations.
jJkNHCTGN1w,i cant really tell the difference in gameplay between fifa 20 and 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Bro I can notice u haven't played football in real life, when you lay off the ball or u do a set up touch it 100% improves ur accuracy cause it kinda gives you a little momentum so u can focus better on the shot"
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay looks smoother
jJkNHCTGN1w,16:47 Papu bloody Gomez FTW lads
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hi Matt I don’t think you’ll reply but do you know when official ratings come out?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Yo Finally some fresh ass scoreboards for cross-league play
jJkNHCTGN1w,Let’s see pro clubs then :))
jJkNHCTGN1w,"It’s funny how the movement of players at times is nothing like an actual human being moves, also the amount of times players aren’t even looking at the ball or goal when they shoot but still flies into the net"
jJkNHCTGN1w,I think this gameplay speed seemes perfect.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Watch the pros complain about defending and say its overpowered.
jJkNHCTGN1w,They should’ve kept the fifa 18 game play but updated everything else
jJkNHCTGN1w,How are the goal keeper?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Coz they make lots of stupid mistakes in 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,pro clubs everything about them
jJkNHCTGN1w,did they end their contract with martin tyler and alan smith
jJkNHCTGN1w,fifa 19.2 or 20? i love pes thank you EA SCRIPT good game players this fifa it' s same shit.....
jJkNHCTGN1w,It's simple; it should only increase accuracy if you where in a bad position before. It gets you out of a bad foot/ball situation. This is how it works in real life and also what makes sense for a game.
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Volta skills, all skills and celebrations and fk"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Finally new gloves and new nike boots :D
jJkNHCTGN1w,The stand tackling seems smoother. Where as in Fifa 19 you rarely tackle and keep the ball
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I play a lot of FIFA....12 and i can see some slight but noticeable differences, i think..."
jJkNHCTGN1w,This gameplay looks great imo
jJkNHCTGN1w,This is fifa 19 Lmao
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Liverpool player rating less than Fifa 19 after they got UCL trophy ?,,,,,,,, are you kidding me?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,What the hell where are martin tyler and alan smith!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Ea sports. It's still the same!!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,please do a liverpool career mode in fifa 20 and stick with it love the videos matt keep up the good work
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay looks really shit tbh change my mind
jJkNHCTGN1w,Moment of silence for double nutmeg on vvd 14:14?
jJkNHCTGN1w,From somebody who played the beta the gameplay is literally the same as 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Where is Peter Drury and Jim beglin in this game
jJkNHCTGN1w,changewillchangeus
jJkNHCTGN1w,Did somebody say fifa19?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Honestly it looks like 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,I just wanna know if first time shots are still broken in fifa 20 or not
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is there a difference in sprint speed Matt? From what you played
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can you move the goalkeeper in fifa 20?
jJkNHCTGN1w,fifa 18 looks sick this year
jJkNHCTGN1w,Lol the speed of passes is insane..
jJkNHCTGN1w,OMG THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AMAZING
jJkNHCTGN1w,is this really fifa20
jJkNHCTGN1w,"These are only the old kits, the rest is new ??"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Arsenal only 4 stars ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"No doubts, this is just Fifa 19 with some new features..."
jJkNHCTGN1w,I uninstalled that fifa 20 after one game
jJkNHCTGN1w,Still looks like fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,do a video on the soundtracks.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Keep quite I wanna hear the commentator damn
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I packed messi in the blah blah 20 beta lol, gold upgrade ?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,This is fifa 19 look at the jersey
jJkNHCTGN1w,Nobody:
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt: categorically CATEGORICALLY cATegORiCaLlY
jJkNHCTGN1w,So basically laying up the ball before a shot is like a timed finish ffs
jJkNHCTGN1w,14:14 van dijk gets destroyed
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I never get this. We had amazing looking games in this console generation: Uncharted 4, Witcher 3, new God of War and much more. But FIFA cannot improve graphics in the new game. Riiiiiiiiiight..."
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 20 will have a very gd gameplay, it changed 360 degrees"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Al the celebrations ??????
jJkNHCTGN1w,"What can you tell about the new ball pyschics, dit you notice it?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do a video on all the new celebrations and skill moves matt including Volta gameplay as well as normal gameplay and try and squeeze some Career mode gameplay and other things if you can thanks x
jJkNHCTGN1w,14:13 best defender in the world
jJkNHCTGN1w,Arsenals rating 4/5 hahahahaahahhahahahahaah FOYG
jJkNHCTGN1w,Limbs Are Back ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Great video but after the 15th different time u said and described the advance layoff i think we got the point but after the 5k time i know everyone here knows  so lets be clear we do not need a tutorial about the advance layoff
jJkNHCTGN1w,Liverpool have lower attack and defence than last year
jJkNHCTGN1w,Trent Alexander Arnold and Robertson do it all the time it definitely makes there crosses better
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can there be different options for the goalkeeper kits because they actually change in real life when it’s away and home this should have been in game
jJkNHCTGN1w,When comes out ps5?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Literally the same game every year
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Ping pong 20 same as allways, running on ice , baddddd!!!!!!"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please do the story mode.. It really looks interesting
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks exactly the same
jJkNHCTGN1w,The same game always!!!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Don’t bother studying the gameplay it will change after the first patch anyway
jJkNHCTGN1w,Ratings are the same as FIFA 19 when it first came out
jJkNHCTGN1w,Also i think that the lay off the ball in reality increases the accuracy .. im sure .
jJkNHCTGN1w,What is your feeling about stamina? From video I feel that they still dont fix stamina impact...
jJkNHCTGN1w,If it’s the same as 19 then fifa is dead . 
jJkNHCTGN1w,Don’t really care about extra features and how beautiful the players look. Just give us good gameplay .
jJkNHCTGN1w,looks same as last year
jJkNHCTGN1w,What has changed? It looks exactly like FIFA 19!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Oh great.. another new OP skill as if the la croquetas aren't enough cancering im really thinking about getting PES and save myself from being angry
jJkNHCTGN1w,Could you do a video of the freekick and penalties
jJkNHCTGN1w,Volta story mode I’ve got jarad HD doing career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,is time finishing and 1 time op?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE SHOW US PRO CLUBS AND ALL THE NEW PRO CUSTOMS , SKILLS AND DO TUTORIAL VIDEOS ON BEST BALL CONTROL AND SHOOTINGS IN F20"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Plasy scouser ? haha good video though bro! ???
jJkNHCTGN1w,It’s one of the only fifas i genuinely believe will be good
jJkNHCTGN1w,The audience looks like it stares into your soul.
jJkNHCTGN1w,CBs still catching up with attackers
jJkNHCTGN1w,i dont agree with you i think it improve the shoot this new skill move in real life
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Why EA speedup the gameplay again, smh."
jJkNHCTGN1w,I will see carrer mode.
jJkNHCTGN1w,WAIT NO MORE MARTIN TYLER?!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,I would say wait all this game be an update by the game u allrdy have id say wait thil fifa 21 on next gen consol
jJkNHCTGN1w,I feel like Mbappe should have been rated between 88-91
jJkNHCTGN1w,I'm liking keeping the ball after a tackle
jJkNHCTGN1w,Make a vid on  celebrations and skills
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wow fifa 15  looks lit  !!! Best ping pong  game on the market !
jJkNHCTGN1w,Yes I want the celebrations
jJkNHCTGN1w,Are these Liverpool ratings official?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I actually like the slower pace. It's more realistic. The graphics are almost the same but it's fine.
jJkNHCTGN1w,More of the same...
jJkNHCTGN1w,"there's a big difference in a ball physics. you can definitely notice it. its only a small detail, but its sick. makes the game look more intriguing."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Thank you for making content Matt!
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay looks clunky and slow
jJkNHCTGN1w,Aren’t those 18/19 kits?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can't wait for fifa 21 on next gen
jJkNHCTGN1w,Going forward finishing Free kicks    going passed opposition players and beating GKs
jJkNHCTGN1w,Who ever reads this you'll succed at everything you do and become very wealthy
jJkNHCTGN1w,Did they improve the pace?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Playing it it feels a lot more realistic imo
jJkNHCTGN1w,A properly timed and placed layoff in most cases increases shot/cross power and accuracy. What are you talking about?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I can really see the difference in sharpness.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can we have new skill moves and celebration video pls ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Early pack opening?
jJkNHCTGN1w,We wanna see all new features only....skills...etc
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The graphics on fifa 19 was good but gameplay was shit. Now that ea have somewhat fixed gameplay from 19, this fifa looks good rn"
jJkNHCTGN1w,There are new game settings for defenders in the section where you set the assisted/manual gameplay settings.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Are Martin Tyler and Alan Smith still commentators in fifa 20?
jJkNHCTGN1w,From this gameplay it looks like headers are gunna be op....PHUUUUUUUK
jJkNHCTGN1w,5:40 take that defender off right now seen 5 year olds do better. If that's what defending is like in FIFA 20 don't even bother releasing it.
jJkNHCTGN1w,what players can you recommend for cheap entry into fut? Like kondogbia or Promes last fifa
jJkNHCTGN1w,Are these the official player ratings
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks exactly the same as fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,I honestly dont see a difference between 19 n 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is he playing fifa 19?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Update : I didn't see the title of the vid, my bad."
jJkNHCTGN1w,lay offs do improve accuracy
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can you make a free-kick tutorial on the new mechanics plz
jJkNHCTGN1w,"My god I’m so glad I skipped Fifa 19, literally no difference at all!"
jJkNHCTGN1w,The over the top through ball look still very unrealistic. 
jJkNHCTGN1w,The player run still look shit
jJkNHCTGN1w,Was or could it be the best ever fifa gameplay?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Thanks for disappointing us again EA you ain't getting my money this year. I'm going for PES 2020
jJkNHCTGN1w,Does fifa 20 have full licensing of Serie A....like the broadcasting package
jJkNHCTGN1w,I hope bit of pace matters.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is first time shots still a problem?
jJkNHCTGN1w,The layoff increased acduracy actually makes alot of sense. Your free kick comparison doesn't work. 
jJkNHCTGN1w,The reason it makes sense is because it gets the ball out of feet and allows for proper shot technique.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Nothing should improve accuracy but aiming it more accurately. Right?
jJkNHCTGN1w,HI MATT CAN YOU PLEASE DO CAREER MODE PLEASEEEE3EEEE
jJkNHCTGN1w,HI MATT CAN YOU PLEASE DO CAREER MODE PLEASEEEE3EEEE
jJkNHCTGN1w,"""Old kits but everything else is new in FIFA."""
jJkNHCTGN1w,"No.. same gameplay, player faces, kits, commentary. Nothing is new except the menu color."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do career mode at the capture event
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt you make fifa more fun  than it is already 
jJkNHCTGN1w,I would crie LITERALLY CRIE if you like this comment
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Matt bro, surely if you've ever played forward or midfield on a football pitch before you should know lay offs improve shot accuracy by a ton. Especially if you're setting it up for your strong foot"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can Goalkeepers get sent off?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is there any new formations ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I'll be pissed if ea removes the multiplier cause of you... 100% A LAYOFF TOUCH IMPROVES SHOT ACCURACY
jJkNHCTGN1w,You’re doing circles mate. Don’t say the same things over and over again.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Bro opening up the ball is pretty much is the skill move ur talking about that why it gives u time
jJkNHCTGN1w,the gameplay feels like pes.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Of course it increases the accuracy when you lay off the ball...if you got more space and time you will shoot more accurate
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why are you playing fifa 19?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"check out my skill goals m8,good vid,i tried a rainbow flick goal but got a penalty lol"
jJkNHCTGN1w,All the skill moves please!! And Volta Football!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,FIFA should hire a good graphics team. They still lacking behind PES on that one.
jJkNHCTGN1w,All the Celebrations!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Word of the video-lay-off
jJkNHCTGN1w,The ratings are the same?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Honestly just looks like your playing FIFA 19....
jJkNHCTGN1w,Layoff touch should increase shooting accuracy however I disagree with the animation. It looks like a street football layoff sometimes
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Everyone saying it’s fifa 19 2.0, how many have played the beta? It looks the same cos it just will cos of the engine being the same. Graphics won’t really change until that but playing the game you can tell that theres a difference"
jJkNHCTGN1w,It's just gonna be the same old scripted shit as fifa 19 was pes this year your me first time in 12 years
jJkNHCTGN1w,That this game carrys the World Cup
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks very choppy and clumsy and the 1st touch looks awful.
jJkNHCTGN1w,All new pro clubs and career customisation features
jJkNHCTGN1w,i feel like this video is all about skill moves tbh i really dont care much for skill moves im more interested in the basics of passing shooting etc the gameplay reminds me lot of pes
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is the gameplay good and hos does the player movement feel?
jJkNHCTGN1w,How’s the switching
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can u play as arsenal I wanna see if certain players have game faces
jJkNHCTGN1w,ive got the beta its alot slower!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Pes20 is releasing in 8 hours , i went a head and told my wife sorry if i ignore you and our children for a few days .... she is understanding"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Nothing changed fifa its still the same...
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please champion pro clubs. Its the most underserved mode in fifa with the highest potential.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please can you do some pro clubs with a few other youtubers
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Trent A-A, Robertson 78-81??? Wtf?!"
jJkNHCTGN1w,All skill moves and celebrations please
jJkNHCTGN1w,cant you all see its fifa 19 [the kits]
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wow I cant believe the gameplay looks the same for 3 years in a row...
jJkNHCTGN1w,Lol why did you cut out 3:16? Is there something you said that you shouldn’t have said ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Did anyone else see TAA being 78 overall?
jJkNHCTGN1w,We need 4k gameplay
jJkNHCTGN1w,It doesn’t even have the new lfc home kit how tf is that fifa 20 gameplay
jJkNHCTGN1w,Who is the real goat??
jJkNHCTGN1w,Like=Messi 
jJkNHCTGN1w,Bring bk team play that was brilliant
jJkNHCTGN1w,I swear all the fifa games from 2013 till now look the same.Nothing has changed.Only team squads.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Am i the only one who saw cavani got 4 Star Skills?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Celebrations for sure?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 19.5 mode spotted with skill mode updates
jJkNHCTGN1w,Game play looks same as 19 :( disappointing from EA
jJkNHCTGN1w,I like the shot thing because it requires skill and isnt certain that youll get a goal like in fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 19? ??
jJkNHCTGN1w,Button delay is still in FIFA why?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"It looks exactly like fifa 19, bruh"

jJkNHCTGN1w,Can't wait till fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Calm on the mid rolls
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can you record Career mode ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,There is virtually no difference in terms of graphics.
jJkNHCTGN1w,"(As stated in the video, current gen consoles have reached their full graphic potential)"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"However, if you looks closely you'll see a very noticeable difference in the fluidity and flow of the game."
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa is dying, it’s dying slowly, but it’s dying"

jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode Matt!
jJkNHCTGN1w,I does it looks more realistic
jJkNHCTGN1w,Seen as Liverpool is fully licensed they should have the players lining up in the tunnel ffs. This is just the same as previous years
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt do u play football?? 
jJkNHCTGN1w,If the ball is moving from a lay of touch in real life it will be more set for the shot
jJkNHCTGN1w,Introduce a game engine like in rush football 2.if that realism joins the supreme graphics of  fifa. Then no one can beat fifa
jJkNHCTGN1w,The neymar celebration is umtitis btw
jJkNHCTGN1w,So Kick off glitch is still there...

jJkNHCTGN1w,Why didn’t you play with Juventus? ???
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 20 career mode every premier League club show the player faces?

jJkNHCTGN1w,"what ? you said you play football yet you didn't think ""layoff advance"" make your accuracy increased ? seriously mate"

jJkNHCTGN1w,Defo do the Volta!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Isn’t that fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Any good catchy songs on FIFA 20?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Everything looks the same. Please tell me they have changed the menu screens. I understand they can’t make massive changes however, making fresh menus gives you the impression they care about eye candy. I’ve been playing this game for years, I feel I give EA £70 just for kit updates."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hope they update all the outdated faces
jJkNHCTGN1w,look how slow the croqueta is :0
jJkNHCTGN1w,Salah should always come out last. EA fix up
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay is the same as FIFA 19.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Gamers: Please improve the game. 
jJkNHCTGN1w,EA Sports: You will buy our game either way ......

jJkNHCTGN1w,Imo in career penalty ratings should go up every one you score but down every one you miss
jJkNHCTGN1w,What happens if you can't defend very well?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 10 was the best fifa, the defense was on point"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The game looks more human and less robotic. A bit more like Pes tbh, like the ball physics seems more real and player movement and skills"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Update Firmino's face, he looks awful"
jJkNHCTGN1w,No Martin Tyler?
jJkNHCTGN1w,noob player know nothing about soccer  always keep skill move
jJkNHCTGN1w,Want realism? play PES 2020.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Who else has the closed beta?

jJkNHCTGN1w,Kepa as Chelsea manager in career mode defo a myth
jJkNHCTGN1w,Other celebrations
jJkNHCTGN1w,Start career mode now
jJkNHCTGN1w,"What about the game modes? The weather affects, all the small things FIFA removes, what about COOP Mode, I want more of this, better replays. No Kit clashes."
jJkNHCTGN1w,There's loads of issues with FIFA19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can you give me fifa 20 i dont have many games pls
jJkNHCTGN1w,carrer mode would be cool
jJkNHCTGN1w,We want see all!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks like it could've just been an update for FIFA 19 or 18 or 17....
jJkNHCTGN1w,Atleast this gameplay looks faster than the slow as shit beta
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why's he posted FIFA19 content when FIFA20 is due out soon.. 0.0
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Jokes aside though, do the crowds have more chants yet? .."
jJkNHCTGN1w,What’s the name of that celebration? Neymar did ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why is TAA 78 rated? He was 80 last year
jJkNHCTGN1w,How are the kick off goals?
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks like pes
jJkNHCTGN1w,"but IN real life,if u do that lay off and then shoot or cross,it will be mre accurate"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"It’s Fifa 19 different coloured, amazing EA, just amazing, everyone will be dissapointed one again.."
jJkNHCTGN1w,#finally some new commenters ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Show us all the National teams
jJkNHCTGN1w,"I LOVE the way the players defend, the way the players tackle like the animations?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,this guy got no clue about football
jJkNHCTGN1w,I hope them ratings are a sick joke
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is the passing system better?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can I just say it looks the exaact same as fifa 19 I don’t know if it’s because of the kits and ratings or graphics but that’s bad
jJkNHCTGN1w,Give us an honest review ffs.. this is why Fifa fails because you don't critique them enough and are just satisfied with small adjustments
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is pace relevant in the game unlike 19?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt please do a liverpool career mode or another team just do a career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,Like so he can see
jJkNHCTGN1w,I sort of agree with the pay off touch accuracy because imo it is realistic. When I knock the ball in front of me in matches. It does help with accuracy for me and power.
jJkNHCTGN1w,If u push the ball before ur shot the shot or cross is more accurate in Real Life....
jJkNHCTGN1w,"necesitan cambiar todo el motor grafico, para que se vean imagenes y detalles realistas"
jJkNHCTGN1w,03:12:00 AM
jJkNHCTGN1w,Show pukki's rating

jJkNHCTGN1w,How is Liverpool def 81??
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why u sound like jack sparrow
jJkNHCTGN1w,Amazing gameplay
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can u do the advanced ball roll while sprinting
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just waiting for the PS5 like..............
jJkNHCTGN1w,Game gets worse and worse every year. Smh
jJkNHCTGN1w,on Fifa Matt on career mode with Chelsea all players are there with new game faces however mason mount the young Englishman isn’t actually in the game at all on fifa 20 beta career  I looked at my squad and transfer list and he isn’t there
jJkNHCTGN1w,Finally a realistic game play without OP skills that makes shity players that think skills will win games lose coz that doesn't happen in real football
jJkNHCTGN1w,Great video ??

jJkNHCTGN1w,wow this looks exactly like fifa 19!
jJkNHCTGN1w,All new Volta skill moves pls
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just got the beta code and ik excited
jJkNHCTGN1w,I wanna hear troopz as commentator on volta
jJkNHCTGN1w,I like the gameplay slow
jJkNHCTGN1w,Does pace matter in game?
jJkNHCTGN1w,You are completely wrong on the set up touch. Absolutely wrong. You're more into arcade Fifa in which shots are accurate no matter what. That's not how it works in real life. I prefer it when Fifa mimics football but you lot try and change the game into something less football and more rocket league with humans ffs.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is still kickoff glitch there??
jJkNHCTGN1w,All new skill moves pls and celebrations pls
jJkNHCTGN1w,Same fifa 19..
jJkNHCTGN1w,the pro pleyras is soo normale the gamepley

jJkNHCTGN1w,Do a vid on manager career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why tf is vvd 85 rated?!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Typical chambo. Injured as soon as he got on
jJkNHCTGN1w,Those graphics are worse than Pes this year. Damn!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Any new leagues?
jJkNHCTGN1w,How does spurs have better attack than liverpool
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hey Matt! What about the game rewarding poor gameplay?? For example scoring  360 degrees shots versus not scoring a well positioned shot in front of the goal? Thanks for the video great content!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Who else subscribed just because of his accent?
jJkNHCTGN1w,if possible plz do the free kicks new mechanics tutorial or gameplay video
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is there any new leagues
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks awful. No fluid player movement like on TV
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why does it look like pes -_-
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is this the default camera angle?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is cross platform in FIFA 20 MATT?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I think that the advanced layoff is good
jJkNHCTGN1w,Does it feel the same as beta
jJkNHCTGN1w,Sorry... going for PES this year
jJkNHCTGN1w,For yall who think he played this game its false. This is the game FIFA used for the offiicial gameplay trailer
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Hi Matt, In this Fifa are there still a lot of rebounds or is that not as OP anymore?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do most useful in-game skills please
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just looks a bit dead not really surprising
jJkNHCTGN1w,Thats not fifa 20 cause the t-shirt of psg for 2019
jJkNHCTGN1w,How do u do an advanced lay off
jJkNHCTGN1w,1 v 1 s against the keeper
jJkNHCTGN1w,Does pace matter ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Kick off glitch???
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The ball control is more realistic, the graphic is improved ..volta is amazing.. I'm gonna buy the normal edition at day one and I will play it for hours and hours ! FIFA IS THE BEST FOOTBALL GAME AT THE MOMENT , THAT'S IT."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Defenders aß fast as strikers;(
jJkNHCTGN1w,I think dribbling is smoother in FIFA 20 than in FIFA 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks like fifa. plays like fifa 19 good job ea
jJkNHCTGN1w,There is still times shots no way I’m buying this crap
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks wank
jJkNHCTGN1w,So no new kits for season FIFA 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Liverpool 85 attack spurs 89 attack
jJkNHCTGN1w,Yes all the skills
jJkNHCTGN1w,Not much different from 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hopefully FIFA 21 available on ps4
jJkNHCTGN1w,This is matts most popular video in the past year
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do pro clubs pleeeaaassseee
jJkNHCTGN1w,No i cannot see the difference other than no more juventus
jJkNHCTGN1w,Hey Matt please go for Volta Story Mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,All the skill move
jJkNHCTGN1w,Surely the player ratings aren't right
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa is supreme at graphics. Plz improve the realism also. Like body language of players movement of ball nd players

jJkNHCTGN1w,CAREER MODE PLEASE MATT
jJkNHCTGN1w,All new skill moves next video please
jJkNHCTGN1w,The gameplay is more like PES
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Idk, the gameplay this year actually looks sick"
jJkNHCTGN1w,You sound like vikkstar
jJkNHCTGN1w,The journey plz
jJkNHCTGN1w,Don't look much difference
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why kit don't new?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode?
jJkNHCTGN1w,looks slow as hell
jJkNHCTGN1w,This ratings are drunk
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Better handshakes, and you can play the UEFA Champions League with Piemonte whatever. Cooooooool."
jJkNHCTGN1w,I rather the slow game play well not so slow but normal pace where  you can actually control possession and take over the game
jJkNHCTGN1w,This is not fifa17.3
jJkNHCTGN1w,It's fifa20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa's gameplay is pathetic
jJkNHCTGN1w,Its fifa19??? Is the same game
jJkNHCTGN1w,"The biggest difference I see is that manual defending looks much more rewarding. Almost 100% of the time when a defender puts in a successful tackle, they actually retain possession or their nearby teammate does. Additionally, the passing looks like it requires a bit more thought as it looks a little more error prone especially from bad body positions. These 2 changes alone, along with the shots from bad angles being nerfed, is gonna make fifa 20 sooooooo much more enjoyable"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wish I had fifa 2020
jJkNHCTGN1w,This gameplay looks much better than the previous leaked ones.
jJkNHCTGN1w,The same man
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is Messi's face different
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt is my favourite YouTuber keep it up
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just looks a bit dead not really surprising.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Just looks a bit dead not really surprising.

jJkNHCTGN1w,Still scripted then
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why same game every year ????
jJkNHCTGN1w,Has auto switching been fixed?
jJkNHCTGN1w,All celebrations pls
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Nice gampleay,bro"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"as long as player switching is good, finishing is consistent, ai defending sucks, no random momentum shifts, this game might be alright."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why do they not fix firmino's haircut
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can it work in fifa18  thumbs down if wrong up If it does don’t really know
jJkNHCTGN1w,You shouldn’t be offside until the player touches the ball
jJkNHCTGN1w,Arsenal 4 star lmao
jJkNHCTGN1w,Whats areola doin in psg??

jJkNHCTGN1w,Why is it the old kit
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 19.5.....
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Only gameplay pls, cut the bullshit with celebrations and skill move videos. Others will do those."
jJkNHCTGN1w,fifa 17.3
jJkNHCTGN1w,u will have a better shot or pass if u lay it off if u really played football u would've known that
jJkNHCTGN1w,Can u do Man City vs Liverpool

jJkNHCTGN1w,Old ratings....
jJkNHCTGN1w,Celebrations
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fc Cincinnati  will dominate for once lol
jJkNHCTGN1w,It not Fifa 20 !
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fabinhos got a head!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,I want ultimate team if possible
jJkNHCTGN1w,All skill moves please Matt
jJkNHCTGN1w,Freak
jJkNHCTGN1w,Pro Clubs please
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please do skill moves vid
jJkNHCTGN1w,this 
jJkNHCTGN1w, vidéo is very exellent
jJkNHCTGN1w,celebration or ball role
jJkNHCTGN1w,Looks like FIFA 19 and slower ?????
jJkNHCTGN1w,Let’s go
jJkNHCTGN1w,Are the ratings right
jJkNHCTGN1w,Not being funny Matt but you clearly haven’t played much football if you think that pushing the ball a couple yards in front of you (which obviously gives you more time and space) won’t improve the accuracy of you’re shot????
jJkNHCTGN1w,What's career mode like..?
jJkNHCTGN1w,passing is really bad ..
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Prendi FIFA 19 e fai copia, incolla, rinomina e aggiungi Volta.. complimentoni!! Ah.. e datti prendere pure tutti diritti sulla Juve.. e chiamala con un nome di m...a.. per quanto mi riguarda avete perso un player"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do Liverpool career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,Volta!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,Same grass same graphics same animation ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 20 using old kit?liverpool defence 81?yes its latest fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,I will not be buying this game anyway.
jJkNHCTGN1w,And why is it every year fifa have Liverpool kicking towards the kop in first half. Everyone knows they do it the 2nd half most weeks. Little small changes like this are crucial
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 18.3
jJkNHCTGN1w,The player movement looks way better. The little things like little taps forward the body movement looks way more human
jJkNHCTGN1w,i don't care about fifa anymore scripting wil be in this game as wel i'm not buying a new fifa shit game and get angry all the time im done with fifa.
jJkNHCTGN1w,19.2
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please make a career mode
jJkNHCTGN1w,Such a weird free-kick follow-through at around 11:45
jJkNHCTGN1w,I love the gameplay more realistic
jJkNHCTGN1w,I honestly can't tell the difference between this and Fifa 16...Parts from a Updated Roster and some slightly better animations. I don't know why people buy this year after year when it's clearly just a cash grab.
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 19,5"
jJkNHCTGN1w,I disagree with u
jJkNHCTGN1w,C'est pas fifa 20 parc 'que ila pa les nouveaux maillots
jJkNHCTGN1w,Mat did u not get the closed beta
jJkNHCTGN1w,Your not very good at conveying your words.
jJkNHCTGN1w,The Var

jJkNHCTGN1w,The only problem with fifa has always been that everyone sucks at it. I mean when most People play they dont play a player or make a pass how you normally would in an actual situation. People just hit the pass button impulsively.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Same game...fifa 14
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa is only after profit , they dont improve shit. Barely invest."
jJkNHCTGN1w,For me it does matter when I shoot and lay off the ball but that’s only when I’m doing faness
jJkNHCTGN1w,Plz do the Volta

jJkNHCTGN1w,Is that the beta
jJkNHCTGN1w,How is alisson 85 and mbappe 87 ??? Both had impeccable seasons
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why does this look like FIFA 19? Why are the ratings the same the jerseys the same?

jJkNHCTGN1w,It’s not a fifa 20
jJkNHCTGN1w,Why are they using last season's kit?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode !!!!
jJkNHCTGN1w,You cannot lay the ball off for yourself in a free kick? Is that a fifa 20 rule?
jJkNHCTGN1w,People constantly go on about better graphics but dont realise consoles cant handle them. Just get a PC then if you want ultra realistic graphics
jJkNHCTGN1w,Am I the only one that they mailed me a code for fifa 20 closed beta ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 20 career mode mangers can’t get sacked for example :Klopp will be manager of Liverpool for 8 years or more without leaving the club that’s a myth
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt is ai still stupidly overpowered
jJkNHCTGN1w,Celebration
jJkNHCTGN1w,FIFA gameplay is a joke

jJkNHCTGN1w,So you recon that lay offs arnt useful coz your mate who recons he can do knuckleballs dosnt use them. As always Matt licking ea arsehole by picking the smallest issue this game literally looks the exact same as fifa 19
jJkNHCTGN1w,Forever Konami Pes
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fresh gameplay & nice video ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Juventus fan:TT
jJkNHCTGN1w,Really conflicted between PES and FIFA. PES has more fluid gameplay but FIFA I feel gives you better control of the play and graphically looks better.
jJkNHCTGN1w,Your not fooling anyone that is the beta
jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode and Volta please
jJkNHCTGN1w,First see the kit than make the video. Fifa 20 shut up
jJkNHCTGN1w,Tricks are still ridiculous.  Why label it as a simulation when it's nothing near real life.  Definitely buying PES this year.

jJkNHCTGN1w,"WOW IT'S FIFA 19 WITH NO IMPROVEMENTS, INCREDIBLE!!!!"
jJkNHCTGN1w,it is not the new football kits
jJkNHCTGN1w,Where is piemonte calcio ?  ????
jJkNHCTGN1w,Van dijk 85 overall ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,What are keepers like
jJkNHCTGN1w,Yeah it should have a margin for error . People that used nothing but that skill absolutely broke the game . If it were the same again then EA would see a huge drop off in sales when people got sick of the same crap .
jJkNHCTGN1w,Mk11 and cod graphics r better
jJkNHCTGN1w,Van Dijk 85 rated wtf?? Are these ratings final ?

jJkNHCTGN1w,https://youtu.be/grcgOl_XOTE
jJkNHCTGN1w,https://youtu.be/grcgOl_XOTE
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Graphics are at its limits for current gen? Thats ridiculous, you have open world games like rdr2 and EA cant improve the graphics on, basically, a side scroller? That’s pathetic, this game has looked the same since fifa 14."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Disagree with lay off touch comments- when u lay off gets out your feet so as long as you aren’t closed down you’ll shoot better
jJkNHCTGN1w,League 1
jJkNHCTGN1w,Pinball
jJkNHCTGN1w,he’s complaining about it making the shot and cross better but irl if you lay off the ball look up and then shoot or cross you’ll be more accurate so it’s realistic
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is ibrox in it
jJkNHCTGN1w,Celebration video
jJkNHCTGN1w,Wow soo cool.... new handshakes. Gameplay looks jusr Like fifa 19. Not fk buying it
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 19??
jJkNHCTGN1w,Career mode series
jJkNHCTGN1w,La Crokefta ??
jJkNHCTGN1w,Facecaaaaaaaam
jJkNHCTGN1w,Fifa 20 ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Do a pack opening @MattHDGamer
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Thank god they have 'more varied handshakes', been waiting for that"
jJkNHCTGN1w,10:00 i actualy like that feature it is treu
jJkNHCTGN1w,This gameplay looks good. But does it really matter since they'll patch it after 2 weeks
jJkNHCTGN1w,Average person: plays one game with Messi he is not bad
jJkNHCTGN1w,Matt: Messi is Amazing best player in the game
jJkNHCTGN1w,Please do all the teams or the new ones that will be in fifa 20 ?
jJkNHCTGN1w,I played loads of fifa this year and I actually can’t really see a change in the graphics from watching this video
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is there still dynamic difficulty?
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Fifa 20 gameplay, or so u thought this is the advanced layoff video!"
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Could you do some, showing the new timed finishing for set pieces?"
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is that the generic freindly design (for the score hub)
jJkNHCTGN1w,Thank God 
jJkNHCTGN1w,I hated the Fifa 19 generic font
jJkNHCTGN1w,"CPU doing drag backs, never seen them  doing in 19."
jJkNHCTGN1w,Is the Piatek celebration in the game?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Yes ! Skill moves lets hear about them all
jJkNHCTGN1w,important question I think everyone is on about. how are the new referees?
jJkNHCTGN1w,Henderson and Fabinho’s faces have been updated
jJkNHCTGN1w,"Gameplay looks no different, disappointed"
jJkNHCTGN1w,They gave arsenal 4 star team ??
jJkNHCTGN1w,It looks more sharp and responsive which I hope is the case and one thing I realised is that the AI midfieldem move in unison rather than individually which I love
jJkNHCTGN1w,A layoff touch does so increase your pass and shot accuracy 
atb3b_Dy3vI,"It's amazing how unnatural the running animation has been in Madden for YEARS now. If it was better, I'd be more excited. The motion just looks so stiff. There's no fluidity."
atb3b_Dy3vI,Its 2019 and madden look exactly the same as 2015!!!! EXACTLY THE SAME!!!
atb3b_Dy3vI,SAME TACKLES. SAME DECISIONS BY AI. ITS THE SAAAAAAAME GAME!!!!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Same ole madden ?????
atb3b_Dy3vI,#boycottmadden20
atb3b_Dy3vI,I didn't know the refs went on strike.
atb3b_Dy3vI,This madden 17 game looks great!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Only thing thats different is the scoreboard at the top of the screen
atb3b_Dy3vI,Madden 19 version 2
atb3b_Dy3vI,Same exact game from five years ago.
atb3b_Dy3vI,Why shepard looking like Odell out there ?
atb3b_Dy3vI,6:26 all the talent on the Browns and they choose to talk about Greg Robinson lmao
atb3b_Dy3vI,Please NCAA! Come back to us!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Eli vs OBJ next season ? Can’t wait
atb3b_Dy3vI,That td by Barkley at the end of the 1st quarter  was isane
atb3b_Dy3vI,but we'll see how good it is and if it has made any improvements.
atb3b_Dy3vI,1:07 - why are they getting ready to kick off with the clock still at 5:15 and counting? Lol
atb3b_Dy3vI,we'll see how good madden 20 is this year because as of recent like the past maddens have been basically copy and paste and haven't brought anything new to the table no disrespect i am just speaking fax
atb3b_Dy3vI,Are all the ball carriers keeping the ball high and tight or some carry it loose?
atb3b_Dy3vI,The line play is the same broken mess it has been for years.  Just watch the OL and DL players engage and then do nothing but wiggle back and forth on EVERY SINGLE PLAY.
atb3b_Dy3vI,I don’t understand why they took the refs out of the field! That’s crazy
atb3b_Dy3vI,So wats kareem hunt overall? Its gotta be 87 or higher tbh..he played wat like 11 games before getting in trouble..i kno chubb is good but he aint better than hunt
atb3b_Dy3vI,"Rightn ow my biggest cimplaitns visually is players still run like robots, and the grass looks almost painted on...."
atb3b_Dy3vI,Madden has been the same for years now
atb3b_Dy3vI,Sgu u gonna do a franchise this year?
atb3b_Dy3vI,No refs!!! Really!!!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Looks exactly the same smh
atb3b_Dy3vI,dude you dont know how to call defense plays
atb3b_Dy3vI,Defense still needs to be fixed. Still trailing guys by five yards.
atb3b_Dy3vI,second play of the game two recv collide and its like what? Make the catch and rubber bounce off each other and  go for +yards? lol ok
atb3b_Dy3vI,i am commenting before i watch the video
atb3b_Dy3vI,I have found Madden 20 is broken on all madden difficulty.  I think it's a result of the new ratings spread.
atb3b_Dy3vI,Why Eli sound like daquan???
atb3b_Dy3vI,Good video. Madden 20 is looking pretty good.
atb3b_Dy3vI,Don't the browns play on grass???
atb3b_Dy3vI,Cleveland will probably win 9 games this year
atb3b_Dy3vI,Should have challenged that first TD his knee was down on the 2nd yard line
atb3b_Dy3vI,Still holds nothing to 2k8 or 2k5 for that matter!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Giants scoring that easy against the Browns? Hahahaha as if
atb3b_Dy3vI,LOL!!! Looks like a Giants fan played against the computer...I hope you feel better about the Odell trade now....LOL!!!!
atb3b_Dy3vI,In that play at 9:30 the defender who was following mayfield just decided to give up on the play. This game is completely broke!
atb3b_Dy3vI,Yeah that was realistic
atb3b_Dy3vI,I Love the way madden 20  Looking down on the field it’s so cool and being able to look up into the stadium see in the crown in it and the sound is so beautiful again I think it’s gonna be wonderful beautiful wonderful beautiful
atb3b_Dy3vI,Good game i kno my team da shit but i jus have 1 question. How da hell do u slide ??? ?
atb3b_Dy3vI,"Game looks terrible, I’ve madden every year since 01 after last years game I can’t spend my money on this at all."
atb3b_Dy3vI,Saquon barley is real on here boe
atb3b_Dy3vI,Wow you are trash. You missed so many open receivers. You could have had a touchdown on your last drive if you threw it to your tight end.
atb3b_Dy3vI,I’m waiting 6 months to buy this . Lol not paying $60 dollars for this....
atb3b_Dy3vI,How can madden get worst from like 6 years ago
atb3b_Dy3vI,"different year, same trash"
atb3b_Dy3vI,So the Giants got better without Odell ? 
atb3b_Dy3vI,Or the Browns defense aint shit ?
atb3b_Dy3vI,Is he playing on all madden or rookie
atb3b_Dy3vI,Madden 21 looks good. Can't wait to purchase it in August 2020.
atb3b_Dy3vI,How do y’all think the halftime is????
atb3b_Dy3vI,"You didn't record the whole game,I guess you lost."
atb3b_Dy3vI,This guy don't need to do no franchise videos. Straight trash
atb3b_Dy3vI,Who's controlling this...horrible defense just need to stop playing Madden all together...all those whiff tackles lmao
atb3b_Dy3vI,I'm not a fan of the browns but I think they will either be 9-7 or 10-6
atb3b_Dy3vI,Your trash I'm sorry you need to learn to play frfr
atb3b_Dy3vI,That literally doesn’t even sound like Eli. Wtf. EA is ass.
atb3b_Dy3vI,Can u do some panthers gameplay next time plz
atb3b_Dy3vI,Or 10
atb3b_Dy3vI,He not good
atb3b_Dy3vI,Where is the option or gameplay mechanic I should say to pull down the ball behind the los with the qb? I thought they were adding that this year or something like that and I haven’t seen anything about it.
atb3b_Dy3vI,I LOVE the fact that they took out the cinematic of breaking the huddle...so no more watching coaches walk the sidelines ??????. Players except for the QB are already set cutting down the start up time for a play. BIG plus for me ??????
atb3b_Dy3vI,No homo but I love me some Baker Mayfield! One hell of a quarterback ????
atb3b_Dy3vI,wow man no offense but you kinda suck at madden
atb3b_Dy3vI,Why is everybody shoulder pads so gotdamn big
atb3b_Dy3vI,"Still sooo amazingly unrealistic. Why does Madden continue to suck year in and year out? Exclusive license. Just imagine how good Madden and 2k would be if the NFL wasn't so stupid, and EA so underhanded."
atb3b_Dy3vI,The lighting looks so much better then madden 19.
atb3b_Dy3vI,When yall gon wake up? You have the power to change these games stop buying these games its the fuccin same
atb3b_Dy3vI,cant wait until this game out 
atb3b_Dy3vI,Game sucks smh
atb3b_Dy3vI,I don’t get why so many people hate on madden every year

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Borderlands 3 is out!?

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Yeeeeeessssss!!! Destroy all humans... Omg I was talking about that game a few months back thinking if they would do a new one.. I swear im psychic!!!
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Hawkeye being in the avengers game would've made up for the best game play to be honest. Options from which arrows to choose them being upgrade able making him the one character that actually requires some hand eye coordination.  He would've made the game a lot more fun.
4tbDcf-n1Xs,So Death Stranding is an apocalyptic fedex game?
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"I think you for got Pokemon, Luigi's mansion 3, animal crossing, Bendy and the dark revile."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I bet there's a Waifu inside that big Backpack ?

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Jokes on you I don’t have a ps4
4tbDcf-n1Xs,destroy all humans remake sucks because it is only a graphical improv
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"these games make me excited about gaming again (took a pause for a few years). call of duty still looks bad though haha. but seriously, how can they evolve it? it's just run and gun. please, devs, forget this franchise and spend your time and energy on new and exciting ideas"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Hope they add a split screen to that destroy all humans remake
4tbDcf-n1Xs,How come no one's talking about little nightmares 2?

4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Cyberpunk, dying light 2 and Watch dogs are the only games coming out between now (Oct. 2019 and Aug. 2020) that im truly excited for the rest have me sceptical or just look plain boring."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Death Stranding looks to me boring AF - overall, no(t many) amazing announcements... Cyberpunk/CDPR is promising, which isn't custom anymore of AAA devs/publishers - and Destroy all Humans could be fun, the trailer is at the very least."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Honestly all I wait for is Cyberpunk
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"I have got „Destroy all humans"" But its real"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I just need gta san andreas 2

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Nice time for the area 51 raid
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Looks like I'll be playing old games.
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"From my experience $60 games never last. Every time a hyped game that cost $60 is released.. there is a chance some of my gaming buddies won't buy due to no money. It really kills all the fun because I'll have to find new ppl to play with. For example, I really want to get CoD Modern Warfare right now, but my friends said they don't want to spend $60 because they literally release a new $60 version every year. Also for Borderlands 3, only 1 of my few gaming buddies got the game. The others don't want to spend $60 on a PVE game. Shortly after a week of BL3, me and the other guy got bored real quick because the whole gang is not playing with us. This is why we all stick to free games like LoL and Fortnite. When new hype game release some of us may go play for for few weeks or a month then back to the free games we can all enjoy together."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,You got the date wrong for dying light it comes out in spring 2020 not June 30 2020

4tbDcf-n1Xs,????? Destroy all humans was funny as hell.

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Weirdest thing is that I used to play destroy all humans while listening to Rammstein I had three albums to choose frome

4tbDcf-n1Xs,"They look as if they were for pegi 3. I might have outgrown of games a little, but lots of these new games actually look worse than before, despite their fancy graphics.

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Great superhero game where we can be a pre-designed characters with pre determined powers and express absolutely ZERO customizability or creativity in the game.
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Beyond the absolute SHIT standard of “DC heroes” or the Marvel top down diablo types superhero games MAKE A FUCKING GAME WE CAN COMPLETELY CREATE OUR OWN SUPERHERO ON AN ENGINE THAT DOESNT FUCKING SUCK IN A GAME THAT DOESNT FUCKING BLOW BY A DEVELOPER THAT DOESNT LOCK US OUT OF BOUGHT CONTENT.

4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Marvel Avenger's looks like a complete cutscenefest of extremely easy and boring scripted fights. Thor fighting human enemies, yeah right rofl. Amazing my ass."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I turned off around 9 mins. 
4tbDcf-n1Xs, These were awful or just didn't make sense. Got a 2080ti there that plays classics in 8k as haven't found any decent fps games. Just waiting for doom eternal tbh.
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"After years of successful open world superhero games, yet they make the same mistake again. Why would anyone want more power than a normal human when he is then limited by the gameworld? Superhero games are all about feeling mighty, and then they lock you onto a path during the whole experience ... when will they finally learn?"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,What about Mobile Stupid
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Ich will is the song name

4tbDcf-n1Xs,The real question is:
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Are they free?
4tbDcf-n1Xs,The NFS trailer is so boring
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"What an abysmal state that gaming has come to, when a heap of these games are either microtransaction-loaded (e.g. CoD or whatever Ubisoft come up with), pseudo-comedic/simple-minded like Borderlands or flat-out remakes of games from a better era. The original 'Destroy All Humans' game was from 2005... what came out around that time,  that might have been in this video were it made back then? Killzone, Far Cry, Rome: Total War, Star Wars: Battlefront, Cold Winter, Black, Battlefield 2, Scarface, SOCOM 3... How did gaming go from that down to being the next Hollywood replete with all the flaws of modern film?"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"So in the new Avengers game is ok to kill, cause a normal human can`t survive hits like the ones Thor and Hulk are giving."

4tbDcf-n1Xs,what the s#it man NO HALO INFINITE ??!!! Are you kidding me?!!
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"I’m done paying double for an HD graphic paint job on uninspiring games that have entirely lost any form of creativity or originality. I used to love games like Zelda, Pokemon, and Banjo Kazooie, but lately it seems like every single game is focused on mecha robots zombies space aliens or guns, idk why I thought 2020 would be any different. I think I can finally say I no longer like video games. At least not the ones they’re making now. I dont need to pay $60 to get part of the game while the rest is DLC. Full, complete games used to be $30. And lootboxes are a whole different story, I should be able to earn extras by playing the game not opening my wallet. Games used to be about being smart, solving puzzles, and the deturmination it takes to get what you got, now theyre about how much money you make at your job (or what your parents make at their job). If I wanted to flex that I have money in real life I’d buy real objects not virtual pixels that only exist when I turn my console on, likewise, if I want to flex that I’m good at video games I’d rather EARN in game rewards, that any other player would know I had to "

4tbDcf-n1Xs,"I'm not against or for Video Games cause violence but look at Dying Light there. Sure lack of parental control is the reason why it can cause violence, but you can't deny the role of the violence in video games. Iknow that it's already too late though to say no to violence in video games as it's been rooted too deep, but I hate when people say that video games causing violence is stupid when there's even clearly violence gore warning on some, if not most, games."

4tbDcf-n1Xs,why r they taking a german song for the language of the alien haha lmao
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"honestly the avengers game is so disappointing. they went for good graphics instead of fun gameplay. the laziest thing a dev could ever do is use quick time events, and all they did was re-use that and made hotkey abilities for each person that seem so underwhelming and boring to use. I don't want to play captain American and all I do is roll and throw my shield with different set animations. why? the entire game is just surface appeal. the only one who looks even remotely fun to play as is hulk and even then its just because it 'looks' good."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I hate the greys! No joke..
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Only 4 titles here are worth something. By Marvel's Avengers gameplay i can say thats why you don't make games about superheroes, they always sucks, and are made only to make $$$, it looks like a crap from 2010..."

4tbDcf-n1Xs,Yup gamin industry is dead to me i see nothing that peaks my interest. All i want is to take WOW and LOTR/hobbits and or pissibly the last kingdom and take them into a blender and make a good RPG in olden days.

4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Sorry but until companies like nvidia/microsoft fix all the shimmering/flickering/bad lod distances/jaggy low quality shadows problems, im not going to buy anything at all. And sadly, i dont think im going to play more than one or two games. My eyes will thank me. I laugh so much when they complain about piracy , and everything they are doing is precisely promote it. Muhahahahah  -"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I think disintegration will be a flop
4tbDcf-n1Xs,??????????????
4tbDcf-n1Xs,The second game is obviously a rip off of Anthem
4tbDcf-n1Xs,PRODUCT NOT YET RATED
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Is it just me, or does it look like 2020 is gonna suck for mew games?"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Sooo the avengers game doesn't have the actors that play the characters voices... A little disappointing
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Marvel's Avengers will be the best.
4tbDcf-n1Xs,So they gave Aiden the same voice actor as Crane? Is this lazy or was cranes actor a fan favorite?
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"all games graphic look terrible, is this year 2000?"
4tbDcf-n1Xs,I don’t get why racing games are so enjoyable for people. Like how are they still making them they’re very boring
4tbDcf-n1Xs,"Borderlands 3 is nothing like 2... humor is awful... very annoying and childish and that's easy to see from the first 2 hours of game play. most of the characters are annoying. Gameplay is meh at best. Guns are not like BL2, the talent tree is extremely streamlined and dull."
4tbDcf-n1Xs,cyberpunk looks terrible
4tbDcf-n1Xs,Muhvg
4tbDcf-n1Xs,destroy all humans mw and marvel avengers for sure
4tbDcf-n1Xs,all rubbish
4tbDcf-n1Xs,ngl these upcoming games don’t look like worth buying
