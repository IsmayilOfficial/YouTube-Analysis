                        "description": "My dearest Snazzy Labs audience,As I write this letter, I realize that it is my last that you will receive.  In a few very short months, I will return to the United States and the world of tech.  My experience here with the people of Bolivia has been unparalleled.  I have met and had the opportunity to help close to 1,000 people and I have made friends that will last a lifetime.Upon my arrival, I will jump back into my routine of making great tech videos.  I have bought a Macbook Air and iPad mini Retina which are awating my arrival.  Obviously, to make tech vids once again, I will need better equipment than what awaits me: good cameras, microphones, a desktop computer, etc.That is where I need your help.Imagine having left to a 3rd world country two years ago and not having heard nor seen basically anything about modern tech.  That is where I am at right now.  When I left:The lastest and greatest iPhone was a 4S (with that tiny little 3.5\" screen) running iOS 5.The \"new iPad\" retina (3rd generation) was brand spanking new.The iPad mini didn't exist yet.The MacBook Pro didn't have a retina model yet and used Ivy Bridge processors.The parallax website phenom didn't exist yet.Apple still gave out the lousy in-ear headphones with their devices.Ice Cream Sandwich was the latest version of Android.I was skinny.  A few of you have seen that I gained a little... well a lot of weight.  LOL.  But Bolivian food is good!  I will be skinny when I get back.Much has changed without my knowledge.  Upon my arrival, I commit to read 2 years of tech news, try-out new devices, basically everything that will be necessary for me to be the Snazzy guy filled with knowledge that I once was.The first video you will see from me will come on May 12.  It will be a friendly welcome-back video with a few exciting announcements. I will also announce an important meeting: \"Snazzy Town Hall\" which will be a live stream on May 17th.  Together, we will decide the future horizon of Snazzy Labs.I thank each and every one of you for your amazing loyalty and support these last two years.  I have the best viewers!As always, and until May, stay snazzy!Quinn",

Here in Bolivia it has been an incredible experience for me and those lifelong friends I have come to know and love.This is a very special time of year -- and not only because it is Thanksgiving season with Christmas around the corner.  On December 8, Snazzy Labs will complete its 5th year anniversary.  It has been an amazing ride.  I started making YouTube videos back in 2008 as a mere hobby to see if anyone would watch.  I recommend you take some time to go back to my first video review of the Bose In-Ear Headphones.  It is terrible!  LOL.  I would have never imagined us to come this far.  We have come a long way since my 3.2 Megapixel Sony CyberShot and iMovie software on my PowerPC iMac G5.   Your love and support has helped me to make over 890 videos which have been viewed millions of times over.2014 will be a very exciting time for Snazzy Labs.  After this video finishes, there will be only one more video update before my arrival back home.  I get back into the good 'ol USA on May 9th.  I will surely need a few weeks to get adjusted to the Gringo-life once again and to play \"catch-up\" on the two years of tech news that slipped through my fingers.  That's not even mentioning the fact that I sold just about all my gear before I left, so I will need to buy new computers, phones, recording equipment, etc .I am confident that we will see a lot of improvements to the way I generate and publish the content.  I will get to re-designing and constructing all my websites that look \"so 2012\" and fine tuning that which is de-tuned.  I also hope to further develop ventures that I have already started such as Headphone Mecca.  I am seriously considering making all my content into both English and Spanish to help balance the unfairly English-based tech world.  Be assured that it will stay your classic \"snazzy\" content you all know and love.I don't know what kind of gear I will have when I get back.  I think I will buy one of the new Mac Pros for video production with a MacBook Air on the side for school and my Netflix cravings.  I think an iPad mini with Retina Display will suit my mobile gaming needs with a Nexus 5 unlocked on T-Mobile until the release of the iPhone 6 in the fall.Well, that's it for this episode.  I wish you all to have a joyous holiday season with your families and loved ones.  I pray that you'll be able to help those in need and have the true spirit of service.  Thanks so much for your continued support and as always, stay snazzy!",

                        "description": "Dear those of you that are still left (nah, that is a joke),It has been a crazy last few months here in Bolivia.  I have moved areas again and am now in the center of Santa Cruz working in the office to help other missionaries with housing, finances, etc.  I went a few days ago to help a poor family cut 1/2 acre of grass with machetes.  My arm hurts writing this.  LOL.  It has been a great experience and the time keeps passing crazy quick!  May 2014 is just around the corner.In downtown Santa Cruz, it is a lot wealthier, and, going to the office, I see a lot of technology.  I have seen a Samsung Galaxy S4, iPad Mini (I want one!) and the iPhone 5.  The Galaxy S4 is a beautiful telephone and I feel like I would prefer it to the hardware of the iPhone 5.  The screen is pretty!I heard about the Apple announcement this past week and I have a few comments.  The Mac Pro looks freaking awesome!  I am so happy that Apple didn't kill the machine off.  The redesign looks amazing.  I am left a little skeptical about this thermal core, but if the fan is actually quiet and the unit stays cool I will be stoked.  At the end of 2013 to save face on taxes, I will have to make a few \"business expenses,\" and a Mac Pro will be one of those.  I am a little nervous that they didn't include the price in the preview.  It is going to cost an arm and a leg...  And then another leg.  The most impressive thing to me (after all of the tech specs of course) is the size.  10\" tall is crazy tiny!  I am happy to see that Apple still has all of their ridiculously unnecessarily bells and whistles like the I/O panel that lights up when the machine senses motion.  Nonetheless, I am stoked to hear that Apple is not trying to kill the desktop, rather, to integrate desktop and mobile a little more tightly.That brings me to OS X Mavericks.  I understand that they ran out of cat names, but Mavericks?  That is a super weird name.  It just makes me think of the NBA.  Don't care about iBooks.  Don't care about Maps.  Don't use Calendar.app.  I prefer Chrome to Safari.  Full-screen apps on multiple displays should not be a \"new feature,\" rather something that needed to be included as a bug fix.  Finder tabs is cool.  Tags seem like something I will never use.  All in all, not a big update.  I wonder how far off Mac OS 11 is.The new MacBook Air update seems nice.  I will be buying one next year for school.  Nobody can complain about better battery.The AirPort Extreme has always been a lousy router in my mind.  Maybe the new one will change the bad history.iOS 7 looks interesting.  I am happy that after 5 years they are finally changing the look up.  I love the lighter, whiter style.  It looks very \"Windows Phone-esque\" if I do say so.  The most pretty is the photo album and iTunes Radio.  The Camera capture button looks kinda out of place.  The new Siri functions make my robot gal look a lot more functional.  I am a little skeptical about this \"iOS in the car.\"   It looks strangely and mysteriously half-baked.  I feel like it is something Steve wouldn't have publicly announced until it was ready for shipment.  That being said, it will be neat if they can convince car manufacturers to change their current setup.  While still loyally committed to Mac, I feel like it will be a tough decision in the mobile game when I get back.Well, back to work!  Nonetheless, I thank each and every one of you for your continued loyalty.  Only 3 more video updates!  I will be back sooner that you all know it.  I have gotten pretty good at my Spanish, and so I will definitely do my videos in 2 languages upon my return.  Should I make \"Snazzy Labs Espa\u00f1ol\" or a whole new network for my Latino audience?  For example like \"Gringo Tech.\"  Send your suggestions and commentaries to my address:Elder Quinn NelsonMisi\u00f3n Bolivia Santa CruzCasilla de Correo 2042Zona CentralSanta Cruz, Santa CruzBoliviaAs always, stay snazzy!Quinn",

One of the biggest changes was Apple's shift away from aluminum to stainless steel. Stainless steel brings a lot of welcomed features, amongst which are: increased grip, rigidity, and heft. But not all is wonderful. iPhone X scratches are very easy to come by and the stainless steel can end up looking pretty nasty in just a few weeks. Snazzy Labs host, Quinn Nelson, shows you how to polish stainless steel back to new. You can use this to remove scratches on your iPhone X, Apple Watch, and other stainless steel gadgets!

Spoiler: it's actually greatGo to https://hostinger.com/snazzy AND use code snazzy to get up to 91% OFF yearly web hosting plans. Buy a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip - https://amzn.to/2ToHF2ySubscribe to my new podcast Flashback - http://relay.fm/flashbackFollow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/snazzyqFollow me on Instagram - http://instagram.com/snazzyqThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip launched to much fanfare in February 2020. Dubbed as the third \"mass-market\" foldable smartphone, this folding phone flipped (quite literally) the display into a clamshell design reminiscent of retro flip phones as well as the newly updated Motorola RAZR foldable. Unlike the Moto, however, Samsung packed some seriously good specs into this handset. You get a 1080p equivalent ultra-wide 21.9:9 1080p-equivalent display, a Snapdragon 855+, 8GB, 256GB+ storage, and all a camera assembly similar to that found in the Galaxy S10. Sure, there have been early reports of durability issues from fellow YouTubers like JerryRigEverything, but we believe they're largely blown out of proportion and whilst Samsung should be chastised for misleading advertising, the glass display is *actually* glass and is *actually* really great. The question, however, remains: \"Is this phone worth $1,400?\" and \"Can the Galaxy Z Flip with 2019 specs really hold a candle to Samsung's 2020 flagship Galaxy S20 line?\" In a way, yes. In other ways, no. One thing is to be sure: this thing is made of glass, it folds, and it's actually really great. #SnazzyLabs #Samsung #GalaxyZFlip",

The Mac Pro is great and all, but its $6,000 starting price point and \"one-size-fits-all-pros\" approach means its financially out of reach for many of us mere mortals. But rather than turn to hackintosh land, why couldn't Apple just make a smaller ATX or mini-ITX sized Mac Pro mini\u2014one with the same upgradable RAM, CPU, GPU, and more for less money and in a smaller case? Snazzy Labs takes a look at the new NZXT H1 mini-ITX SFF case. With a built-in AIO, SFF PSU, and PCIe riser card for the GPU, this case is ready to rumble from the factory. Just insert your mini ITX motherboard, attach the cooler, plug-in the pre-wired cables and insert your GPU. That's it. You're done. The whole build takes less than 10 minutes. Pretty freaking awesome for what are historically nightmarish cases to build in.",

Is Autopilot still the clear winner on the road and in the parking lot? This is more than just a Smart Summon party trick. Let's go in depth.",

In the early 90s, they moved from Motorola's 68k platform to IBM's PowerPC architecture. For a few years, Apple made the fastest personal computers on the planet. But PowerPC had a number of issues and Apple was forced to move to Intel in the mid 2000s. It was a good transition and helped the Mac a lot, but it's now time for Apple to transition once again leaving Intel, AMD, and the x86 architecture in the dust. Hello, ARM. The new Apple-made custom chips for Mac could be a game-changer and could make Apple exciting again.

Rumors have been sky high this year and famous leakers like Ming-Chi Kuo have been hard at work fronting the iPhone rumor train.

Apple's releasing a new Modular Mac Pro this year to be likely announced at WWDC and while many Apple fans are excited, I think it's going to be a bit disappointing. What should be an attempt to replicate Apple's famous cheese grater Mac Pro in a smaller SFF form factor, I think Apple may go with a stacking modules approach like Mac mini. This isn't a good system and it's not what pros want. I show a killer mini-ITX Hackintosh build inside the Dr. Zaber Sentry 2.0 to demonstrate what could be done. Just give us an upgradable Mac Pro so we can stop building hackintosh machines!#MacPro #LGUltraFine #32UL950",

Human drivers are increasingly distracted, very unsafe, and slow to react with limited vision and senses. Believe it or not, however, making self-driving autonomous cars isn't a walk in the park. After nearly 10 years since Google started its Waymo self-driving project, I take one of their autonomous taxis out on the road and talk about its quirks and features. It's better than Tesla Autopilot and the self-driving project from Yandex, but is it ready to drive fully driverless?#Waymo #Driverless #Autonomy #WaymoAmbassador",

Unfortunately, the days for Mac VR support are still early and Snazzy Labs' Quinn Nelson talks about shortcomings that might force you to hold off\u2014or to buy a PC for your VR needs instead.Follow me on Twitter - http://twitter.com/snazzyqFollow me on Instagram - http://instagram.com/snazzyq",

With a new all-screen design, iPhone X looks pretty great\u2014or at least, it has finally caught up to the Galaxy S8, LG V30, and other flagship phones from this year. The most immediately noticeable omission is the home button and Touch ID. Apple has moved to a gesture-based user interface. At first, it sounds pretty neat! But the more I think about it, the less convinced I am that it is going to be better than the classic home button. I suggest an alternate design I wish Apple would have considered.",

                        "description": "Let\u2019s talk about ads on Snazzy Labs. I started this channel nearly 9-years-ago. What started as a hobby has become a near full-time job which I\u2019m incredibly grateful for. Being able to make money doing something I love and am passionate about is awesome. But not only am I a creator\u2014I\u2019m also a viewer of a lot of other channels. I\u2019ve been in your shoes. And I know how much ads can suck. The purpose of this video is to help to find an equilibrium\u2014where you don\u2019t hate the ads I do when I have to do them, where the brands I work with are happy with the results, and where I\u2019m able to continue YouTubing as a career and grow my channel even further.Why do I have to do ads in the first place? Doesn\u2019t YouTube pay enough? No. Google is continuing to pay it\u2019s creators less and less money. Last month, my channel got 4x the amount of views that it did in the same month of last year, but I got paid about the same amount\u2014so YouTube is paying 4 times less than they did last year. Many YouTube Creators have come to rely on platforms like Patreon\u2014where the audience pays the creator. Maybe that works for them, but I\u2019m not comfortable with that. Ads are a far better solution. They pay way more money, and so I can do them less often. Right now, I only have ads on about 1 in 5 videos. If I moved to Patreon, I\u2019d have to beg for money at the beginning and ending of every single video to match what advertisers are paying me now. YouTube is a free platform, and you shouldn\u2019t be expected or guilt-tripped into supporting me financially when brands are so anxious to advertise on my channel.At the same time, I refuse to let the premium quality content I make, be watered down and cheapened by crappy ads. Here are the promises I make to you as a viewer:1. I will only ever work with brands whose product I use and love\u2014I get emails every single day offering a LOT of money to sponsor or advertise on videos\u2014and I say no to nearly all of them because I will never advertise for crappy services or products because that\u2019s not fair to you\u2014to be told something is good when it isn\u2019t.2. Brands are not allowed to alter or change my ad integration. A lot of you didn\u2019t like the Privacy ad from my last video. It was a 4 minute ad in an 8 minute video. If I could go back in time, I\u2019d do it shorter. I apologize. But the ad wasn\u2019t 4 minutes because Privacy said so, or because it was in the contract. It was 4 minutes because I really genuinely love the service and wanted to demo all of its cool features. I don\u2019t allow brands to dictate how I make my videos. I apologize for the super long ad, I\u2019ll exercise more self-restraint, and it won\u2019t happen again.3. I will NEVER do a paid review. I will always verbally state in the video, and disclose in the video description if a product is sponsored. Furthermore, I pride myself on journalistic integrity and will not provide special treatment to brands that have advertised with Snazzy Labs in the past.4. I will NOT do fully-sponsored videos\u2014because those are B.S. For example, Wix, the website building software company, paid a ton of YouTubers a LOT of money last year to make an entire video about their service. And no offense to the YouTubers that accepted, but I said no. Not only because I don\u2019t think Wix is a very good service, but because videos where the whole thing is an ad are not genuine, they cheapen my brand, and most importantly, they\u2019re not fair to YOU as a viewer. That\u2019s not the content you subscribed for.5. I will only advertise when by doing so, I can continue to provide unique, non-clickbait, and high-budget videos that would not be possible without support from advertisers. I have an incredibly cool video next week that\u2014spoiler alert\u2014is sponsored, but it\u2019s a very expensive project that would not have been possible otherwise. And it\u2019s a freaking cool video that\u2019s well-worth sitting through a short little ad.I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers on the best way to advertise\u2014given the negative feedback from my last video\u2014it\u2019s apparent I still have a lot to learn and experiment with, so I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the types of advertisements you\u2019ve seen on both this channel and other channels that you\u2019ve either liked or hated and provide suggestions in the comment section below for how I can continue to make Snazzy Labs videos the most unique tech videos on the Net. Thanks so much for watching, thank you millions for your support, and as always, stay snazzy.",

It has a Snapdragon 810, 4GB of RAM, a 3,300 mAh battery, but do they all work in harmony? Snazzy Labs reviews the OnePlus 2 in this OnePlus Two Review.",

The Mac Pro is great and all, but its $6,000 starting price point and \"one-size-fits-all-pros\" approach means its financially out of reach for many of us mere mortals. But rather than turn to hackintosh land, why couldn't Apple just make a smaller ATX or mini-ITX sized Mac Pro mini\u2014one with the same upgradable RAM, CPU, GPU, and more for less money and in a smaller case? Snazzy Labs takes a look at the new NZXT H1 mini-ITX SFF case. With a built-in AIO, SFF PSU, and PCIe riser card for the GPU, this case is ready to rumble from the factory. Just insert your mini ITX motherboard, attach the cooler, plug-in the pre-wired cables and insert your GPU. That's it. You're done. The whole build takes less than 10 minutes. Pretty freaking awesome for what are historically nightmarish cases to build in.",

Rather than rush and put a messy review up as soon as we could, we have spent the last 40 days with it putting it through its paces and seeing if it can really compete against the Sony, Eizo, vs Flanders Scientific monitors of the world. We break down the 6K resolution, connectivity issues, GPU limitations, the $1,000 monitor stand's strengths and weaknesses, the display panel's viewing angles, color accuracy, luminance, light rolloff, vignetting issues, HDR capabilities and alleged 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.

So what GPUs can help accomplish those tasks better. What about a new generation NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super or last-gen NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti? Apple blocked NVIDIA\u2019s Mac web drivers in Mojave so only older Macs can use their GPUs in macOS. But will it work in Windows via Boot Camp or virtualization in Parallels or VMWare? Maybe we should try out an AMD 5700XT GPU which has killer performance for the price and is compatible with macOS? Let\u2019s find out all of this and more!",

While many argue about the value proposition and the preposterously high $5,999 starting price point, nobody is arguing about the added value of good 'ol\u2014tried and true\u2014PCIe slots. Will an PCIe NVMe SSD work inside of Mac Pro? What about a 4K Capture Card to use in Blackmagic's Davinci Resolve or OBS for streaming? Or, how about a USB expansion card to add to the relatively scant I/O? Perhaps a replacement GPU from NVIDIA would work for gaming on a Mac? Or, maybe, a sound card with a reasonably high end DAC and headphone amplifier? As a follow-up to our Mac Pro teardown and our Mac Pro review which will be forthcoming, we answer the question: what stuff can you put in a Mac?",

With essentially no competition, innovation has slowed and prices have hiked upwards. The iMac, Mac Pro, and MacBook lines have suffered due to inefficient processors that put of a lot of heat but while providing mediocre performance. AMD's new Ryzen architecture has taken the PC market by storm. It's highly unlikely that Apple will drop Intel as a partner in favor of AMD, but that doesn't mean we can't make our own AMD Ryzen Macs!

At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure the CPU coolers were the same across all 27\u201d models. I have since learned that they are; so if you buy the cheapest 5K iMac, you can do all the upgrades I mention in this video without issue.Footnote #2: This is not an instructional disassembly video. I recommend checking the guides on iFixit. They are well illustrated\u2014provide adequate caution and warning for tricky areas\u2014and have a community section where people provide advice. At the time of this video, there is no updated guide for the 2017 iMac; however, it's very similar to the 2014-2015 A1419 model. The only big difference is the screw placement on the motherboard. Just take your time finding all of the screws (one is hidden through the gold hole in the middle of the board) and you'll be fine.Footnote #3: A little drama that wasn't included in the video is that the first time around, the CPU got bumped out of the socket when I screwed in the cooler, so the CPU wasn't seated correctly and the computer didn't boot. Upon disassembling the machine again, I saw the CPU was out of the socket and partially bent. I bent the CPU back (silicon bends easily without damaging, luckily), reinserted it into the socket, and was more careful when I tightened the CPU cooler the second time. It's easy to wiggle the CPU out of place when installing the cooler, so be careful\u2014and if it feels too hard to tighten the CPU socket, stop\u2014something is wrong.Footnote #4 - My machine's GeekBench results: http://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/3...The 27\" 5K iMac is a good computer for many; however, to users that want high-end specs, Apple charges way too much money.

                        "description": "Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of \u201cdisparate impact\u201d and how it disregards the American legal principle of \u201cburden of proof.\u201d Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like \u201cdisparate impact\u201d fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child\u2019s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family.

Will and Robinson discuss a quote from his 1984 book, Statecraft as Soulcraft: What Government Does, \u201cThe United States acutely needs real conservatism, characterized by a concern to cultivate the best personas and the best in persons. It should express appreciation for the ennobling functions of government.\u201d They use this quote as a launchpad to discuss the future of American politics.The discussion turns to young adults and teenagers, and Will argues why history should be a required class for all college students.

Ross Douthat explores that question in his new book, To Change the Church: Pope Francis and the Future of Catholicism. Douthat joins Peter Robinson on Uncommon Knowledge to discuss his new book, his thoughts and critiques of Pope Francis, and the changing conception of divorce under Pope Francis\u2019s ambiguous teachings. Douthat and Robinson spend a large portion of the episode discussing the Catholic teachings surrounding marriage, divorce, and communion. They examine the history of Catholicism and divorce, going back so far as to understand the lessons of the New Testament on divorce and how those lessons were radically conservative for the time. They talk about how problematic the terms \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d are when used in the context of the Church as the political leanings do not necessarily correlate with moral leanings of religion. They go on to discuss the future of the Catholic Church under Pope Francis and how the Bishops can handle all of the changes.

He discusses his book Fear No Evil: The Classic Memoir of One Man\u2019s Triumph over a Police State, which details a compelling account of his time in a Soviet prison and the inspiration he found in himself, the Tehillim, and Ronald Reagan\u2019s speeches about freedom. Sharansky realized through KGB interrogations and his time in prison that nobody but himself is responsible for his own human dignity. Sharansky also becomes fully aware of how important freedom is\u2014especially the freedoms included in the US Constitution and that Reagan often refers to in his speeches.Sharansky's interview should open eyes and minds to the lessons learned from silencing people we disagree with. The examples of silencing dissent, resulting in the empowerment of Stalin and the strengthening of the former Soviet Union, should be a lesson for all of us: to listen to ideas and views we may not agree with, and to speak up when we believe our friends and country are going in the wrong direction.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/fear-...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

However, Niall Ferguson, author of The Square and the Tower, argues that networks are not a new phenomenon and have been impacting human culture from the beginning of history. Niall Ferguson and Peter Robinson discuss networks and hierarchies throughout history in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Ferguson breaks down what he means by networks and hierarchies using the imagery of the Piazza Del Campo in Siena, where the Torre del Mangia, representing the hierarchy, casts a long shadow over the Piazza Del Campo, representing the network. Ferguson argues that this powerful imagery invokes the essence of his book and the intertwined nature of networks and hierarchies within society. Ferguson goes on to discuss the importance of networks in social movements throughout history, including Martin Luther and the Reformation, Paul Revere and the American Revolution, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union, and social media and Donald Trump. He argues that a networked world is a dangerous world, in that it allows movements and societies to advance in unexpected ways.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/niall...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Mattis sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss a wide range of issues facing the United States Armed Forces at home and across the globe. Earlier this year, Secretary Mattis published the National Defense Strategy, the first such document in a decade. Secretary Mattis describes why the document is an important blueprint for the Armed Forces and what he hopes to accomplish by publishing it. After a moving story about a captured Iraqi suicide bomber, Secretary Mattis describes the complicated nature of our relationship with China and the possible flash points in the South China Sea. A discussion follows about Europe and how political controversies with Russia affect our military relationship and why Secretary Mattis believes NATO is not a threat to them. Moving on to the Middle East, Secretary Mattis defines our mission in Syria, comments on the use of chemical weapons, and explains why that theater is the most complex security conundrum he\u2019s seen in his forty-year career. He says that the refugees coming out of Syria are more traumatized than refugees he\u2019s seen anywhere else in the world. He discusses the need to work with the international community on the refugee crisis as, \u201cIt is a tragedy much worse than anything BBC or CNN can show.\u201dIn the Far East, Mattis describes how a coordinated effort across different departments of the US federal government and allied countries have achieved a dialogue that may lead to the denuclearization of North Korea. Secretary Mattis also makes the case that the Iranian regime and the Iranian people are different constituencies with different priorities and agendas. He relates how he is reforming the Pentagon\u2019s provisioning and spending policies and why it\u2019s important for the military (the seventeenth largest economy in the world) to be a responsible steward of the nation\u2019s tax dollars.

Our guest today carried the state by twenty-one. Senator of Ohio Rob Portman joins Peter Robinson at a special live taping of Uncommon Knowledge. They discuss the 2018 tax bill, the opioid crisis, the Parkland shootings, North Korea, and much more. Senator Portman stands by his decision to vote for the new tax bill as he has seen the benefits right in his home state. He recounts several anecdotes of his constituents who have already seen benefits from the new tax bill. He tells the story of one small-business owner who is finally able to offer health care to her full-time employees because of the tax breaks for small businesses. He also discusses meeting with microbrewers who are now able to expand their facilities and grow their businesses because of the tax cuts. Portman also discusses how the new federal budget helped the Department of Defense and the US military to build out their forces in order to project strength abroad. He explains ways that the Republicans and Democrats were able to compromise on increasing domestic discretionary spending so that they can also spend equally on defense. He recounts examples of bipartisanship in order to help Congress get work done. Senator Portman goes into great detail about the opioid crisis a huge issue in his state. Portman is working hard to increase treatment programs for addicts to end the crisis. He tells a story about one young man he met who will be able to become sober and regain his life back because of the new treatment programs. Peter Robinson takes the interview into a lightning round near the end of the program, asking Senator Portman quick questions for quick answers about his thoughts on the situation with North Korea, the Parkland shootings, conservatives and Donald Trump, and why Portman continues to be in public service. Portman ends the interview by explaining why public service matters to him more than making significantly more money in the private sector.About the Guest: Senator Rob Portman is a junior senator for the state of Ohio. He has served as a senator since 2011. Senator Portman previously served as a US Representative, a United States Trade Representative, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

This episode\u2019s guest, Stephen Kotkin, author of Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941(https://www.amazon.com/Stalin-Waiting...), examines the political career of Joseph Stalin in the years leading up to World War II, his domination over the Soviet Union, and the terror he inspired by the Great Purge from 1936\u201338. \u201cWhy does Joseph Stalin matter?\u201d is a key question for Kotkin, as he explains the history of the Soviet Union and Stalin's enduring impact on his country and the world. Kotkin argues that Stalin is the \u201cgold standard for dictatorships\u201d in regard to the amount of power he managed to obtain and wield throughout his lifetime. Stalin stands out because not only was he able to build a massive amount of military power, he managed to stay in power for three decades, much longer than any comparable dictator. Kotkin and Robinson discuss collectivization and communism and how Stalin\u2019s regime believed it had to eradicate capitalism within the USSR even in regions where capitalism was bringing economic success to the peasants, with the potential of destabilizing the regime. This led to the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression that resulted in the exile and execution of millions of people.

Stalin\u2019s goal was to defeat the West and he saw the pact as an opportunity to do so by driving a wedge between Germany and the capitalist West. Kotkin analyzes Stalin\u2019s decisions leading up to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union and the disinformation Germany was feeding soviet spies to prevent Stalin from moving against Hitler first.

                        "description": "Recorded on June 22, 2018Will the United Kingdom really follow through on Brexit? British politician Daniel Hannan believes that Brexit is happening and cannot come soon enough. As a staunch proponent for the \u201cVote Leave\u201d side, Daniel Hannan has been ready for Brexit since the referendum vote in 2016. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about what Brexit means for the UK, how soon it\u2019s coming, and the likelihood of compromise between the now polarized British parties.The United Kingdom became a member of the European Union in 1973. In June 2016, in a close 52 to 48 vote, UK citizens voted to leave the EU. Two years later and the UK is less than a year away from their deadline to leave by March 2019. Guest Daniel Hannan explains that while Brexit will ultimately be a good thing for the UK, arguments in Parliament have dragged out the question of if Brexit will happen, even though it\u2019s already been settled by a referendum. Hannan argues that polarization amongst parliamentary parties is preventing real negotiations from taking place that will allow the UK to find the best compromise and regain their voting powers that citizens feel were diminished by membership in the EU. Hannan explains where the Brexit process is at in Parliament and what he feels is the best course of action for the EU moving forward.  About the Guest: Daniel Hannan is a British writer, journalist, and politician. Since 1999, he has been a Conservative Member of the European Parliament for South East England. He is the founding president for the Initiative on Free Trade. His most recent book is What Next: How to Get the Best from Brexit.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/how-g...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Following a unique format, Robinson asks each of the guests the same questions to get their distinctive perspectives on issues such as the rise of authoritarianism in Russia, communist China, and the prospects for democracy. The guests include the former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, Nick Clegg; former president of Mexico, Felipe Calder\u00f3n; former president of Estonia and current Hoover visiting fellow, Toomas Hendrik Ilves; and former prime minister of Denmark, Anders Fogh Rasmussen. The guests analyze economic growth in China and how that growth did not lead to the democratic country predicted by economic experts in 90s. They dive into why China does not truly have a free market, nor does it follow traditional Leninist/Marxist communism\u2019s disdain for material goods. The guests go on to analyze changes in Russia in the last thirty years under President Putin and how foreign policy with Russia has affected their respective countries. They discuss the future of Russian and Chinese relations and how they believe those two countries are trying to shape the world. About the Guests:Nick Clegg was the deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2015. Felipe Calder\u00f3n was the president of Mexico from 2006 to 2012. Toomas Hendrik Ilves was the president of Estonia from 2006 to 2016. He is currently a Hoover visiting fellow.Anders Fogh Rasmussen was the Prime Minister of Denmark from 2001 to 2009.

John Yoo, Yale Law alumnus and Hoover Institution visiting fellow, breaks down Kavanaugh\u2019s law career in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Yoo argues that the United States has concentrated too much power in the Supreme Court since the New Deal era legislation and that the Supreme Court is now more powerful than Congress and the President. Based off of Kavanaugh\u2019s past career, Yoo predicts that Kavanaugh will help reign in the power of the Supreme Court and give it back to the states.Yoo argues that based off of the Constitution, power to decide social issues should reside with states rather than the court. According to Yoo, prior to the New Deal era, the Supreme Court focused on regulatory issues rather than social issues. He argues that momentous social legal decisions like Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges are meant to be left to the individual states to decide.Yoo analyzes the records of the current conservative justices and predicts that Kavanaugh will side more often with Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch, interpreting the Constitution as it was written by the founders, rather than by the changing will of the people.About The Guest:John Yoo is a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and a professor of law at the University of California Berkeley school of Law.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/judgi...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

George Gilder, author of Life After Google, argues that bitcoin and blockchain technology is revolutionizing the Internet. He sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss technology, cloud computing, big data, and the growing role of blockchain in innovating new technologies.Gilder argues that cloud computing, while it was the hot new technology ten years ago, has reached its limits as the physical limitations of big data storage centers maxes out. Improvements in parsing big data are incremental at this point, and it\u2019s time for the next big technology to take its place. Gilder points to blockchain as the technology of the future, with its ability to prevent corruption and manipulation of transaction data and the infinite uses it could have in third world countries.Gilder also discusses the history of technology, artificial intelligence, and the revolutionary bitcoin. He argues that artificial intelligence can never replace human intelligence and creativity and that in principle, it is impossible for machines to take over.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/georg...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Here to discuss what happened then and where the world is now are former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne. Kevin Warsh and George Osborne discuss the 2008 financial crisis, how they dealt with it at the time, what they would have done differently, and whether the economy is headed toward another downturn. Warsh discusses how the United States failed to realize how bad the crisis was until it was already too late. The crisis had a huge impact on Europe and the United States and set off a global panic. However, within two years the economy was already growing by 2 percent and the quantitative easing used by the Fed was no longer needed as the world changed. Warsh and Osborne analyze the state of the US and UK economies today and the trade war with China. They argue that there are two ways to approach China: either try to contain it or co-opt it. Innovation and growth in the United States are necessary to prevent China from gaining more purchasing power and greater influence on the international market.  Osborne analyzes the effects Brexit could have on the single market and trade with the UK\u2019s geographically closest trading partner, France, and airs his concerns about what Brexit means for the UK\u2019s future. He argues that Margaret Thatcher, who helped create the single market in the EU, would never have voted to leave it. While a future financial crisis is always possible, Warsh and Osborne end on optimistic notes: that there is still room for growth in the two countries\u2019 economies and that a better financial future for many Americans and British is still possible through good economic policies, including lower taxes and less regulation.For the full transcript go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/how-w...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

He explains how Britain\u2019s entry into the European Union first came about under Margaret Thatcher. He argues that British citizens had objections to joining the European Union back in 1973 and those objections never went away. Over the past forty-five years, the British have become increasingly more skeptical and frustrated with the European Union and resent the degree of its interference in the government\u2019s decision making. O\u2019Sullivan and Robinson talk about the upcoming March 2019 deadline set by Theresa May for Brexit to officially occur. They talk about the state of the government as it stands, its preparedness for Brexit, and the opposition to Brexit by some parts of the government and the younger citizens.

He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master\u2019s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell\u2019s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell\u2019s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

By the age of twenty, Bush had flown fifty-eight combat missions and had been shot down once. After the war Bush finished his education and went on to become an expert in foreign policy as ambassador to the United Nations and then as director of Central Intelligence. Bush was president during the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and oversaw the nonviolent transition period from the Cold War to peacetime. They remember the former president\u2019s graciousness, kindness, humility, and desire to help others (and not hold grudges), and they discuss how those qualities translated into his life and political career.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Bush, C Boyden Gray and Haley Barbour join Peter Robinson to discuss fond memories of his leadership, friendship, humility, and legacy. They discuss the 41st President\u2019s involvement in the Clean Air Act, the reputational teeter totter the public had with him and Reagan, and his foreign policy decisions. They talk about Kuwait and the first Persian Gulf war and speculate that if President Bush had decided to go after Saddam Hussein then the Iraq War in the 2000s could have been avoided. They argue that President Bush took foreign policy in a good direction for the United States in the wake of the Cold War. They go into detailed analysis about President Bush, the issues he faced, and how he worked for peaceful negotiations, and was grace under fire.President George H. W. Bush was a gentleman of a past generation, says Robinson. They discuss whether or not being a gentleman is still something to aspire to in politics and in the office of the president.

Click here: https://www.npr.org/tinydeskFollow NPR Music:Twitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusicInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusicMarch 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. \"It just feels like you're in the way,\" he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.Backed by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to \"Watermelon Sugar,\" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in \"Adore You.\" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.Styles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.But beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance \u2013 and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.\"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. \"It's nice here.\"We \u2014 and our massive crowd of colleagues \u2014 couldn't agree more.SET LIST\"Cherry\"\"Watermelon Sugar\"\"To Be So Lonely\"\"Adore You\"MUSICIANSHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocalsCREDITSProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR",

This isn\u2019t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you\u2019re probably familiar with. Instead, it\u2019s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that\u2019s more similar to rotisserie chicken\u2014except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat.

You might not think they\u2019d have beef as they rarely saw each other on the court, but as Shaq moved into his role as analyst with a big personality, their adversarial relationship developed. They have a sort of a big brother-little brother relationship. Not in the sense that Shaq looked out for JaVale or anything like that, no certainly not. More in the sense of... Shaq teased JaVale until it became a real fight so vicious Mom had to step in. Seriously their moms got involved.What spurred this beef?  2.75 words: Shaqtin A FoolJaVale McGee was featured on the blooper segment more than any other player, ever. And guess what? He didn\u2019t like that. This is a classic tale of a joke gone too far. And because this joke went too far on national television, year after year, it\u2019s only natural that things blew up into a hearty cut of well-seasoned beef.Written and produced by: Clara MorrisDirected by: Ryan SimmonsEdited by: Ryan SimmonsSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com#SBNation #BeefHistory",

For fabric ties: use a strip 1\u201dx 18-20\u201d. Fold one short end 1/4\u201d in and sew. Next fold the fabric strip long edges in so they meet in the center then fold in half length again. Sew down the open edge to secure. Place the tie with the raw edge next to the corners of the mask just like the elastic was. Tip: Make sure not to sew over the loose end of the tie as you sew around the mask. Kids size:  make fabric 5\u201dx7\u201d, and elastic 5\u201d long.*** Please wash thoroughly after each use! **** Use tightly woven fabric, or hospital grade material.* Keep in mind men and women will be wearing the masks when choosing fabric for mask that will be donated.* Contact local health facilities to see if they are in need of donations. Currently, the supply of surgical masks is at a critical all-time low throughout the entire nation. As a community of sewists, this is a great way we can band together and make a huge difference in this time of need! While handmade fabric face masks are NOT a substitution for N95 masks, in times of emergency, the CDC may allow handmade fabric masks to be used when critical shortages take place. You can read more from the CDC here on the use of homemade masks here: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-...According to the CDC website \"homemade masks should ideally be used in combination with a face shield that covers the entire front (that extends to the chin or below) and sides of the face.\" In addition to helping medical staff during critical shortages, these masks can be used at home as well. While wearing homemade face masks will not prevent against catching a respiratory illness, they can help reduce the spread of large particles when someone sneezes or coughs. *** PRODUCTS USED **** Fabric: Bonnie and Camille* Juki TL2000 Qi: https://amzn.to/2MYdOZu* Aurifil 50wt Thread: https://amzn.to/33gN1Af* Oliso Pro Smart Iron: https://amzn.to/2ZbppJE* Scissors: https://amzn.to/2tvesWm* Wonder Clips: https://amzn.to/2tr1s4e*** QUILT on the Wall Behind me ***Vintage Spring Quilt Pattern: http://bit.ly/2IMAGw2**** Shop ERICA'S SEWING FAVORITES Here! **** https://www.amazon.com/shop/ericaarndt****  FIND ME HERE **** Email me: erica@confessionsofahomeschooler.comeCourses: http://go.confessionsofahomeschooler.comWebsite: http://www.confessionsofahomeschooler...Store: http://store.confessionsofahomeschool...COAH Homeschool Community: https://community.confessionsofahomes...Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ericaarndt/ YouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/EricasHom...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Confessionso...Twitter: http://twitter.com/ericahomeschoolPinterest: http://pinterest.com/ericahomeschoolRavelry: https://www.ravelry.com/people/EricaA...****  ****  **** Disclosure: This is not a sponsored video.

In today\u2019s\u00a0#Minilogue\u00a0Jimmy celebrates #FormalFriday by dressing up as if he is going somewhere \u2013 even though we\u2019re all stuck at home. If you dressed up today and want to share your experience, post photos and videos with #FormalFriday and Jimmy will show some of his favorites next week. Jimmy also talks about online comments regarding his appearance, Trump lashing out at NBC\u2019s Peter Alexander, Sean Spicer showing up at the press briefing, some Senators selling off massive amounts of stock shortly after a Coronavirus briefing, the toilet paper crisis, and most of Las Vegas shutting down. During times like these, it\u2019s also good to check in on old friends, so Jimmy talks to Brandon Flowers and Ronnie Vannucci of The Killers via webchat, and they perform \u201cCaution\" from their new album \u201cImploding The Mirage.\" Jimmy will be making a donation to a worthwhile cause every day during this quarantine. Today, it\u2019s the USBG Foundation\u2019s Bartender Emergency Assistance Program. Please consider helping them.

I really enjoyed this process, it was really fun, and there are so many possibilities, especially if you are willing to do something different on each shoe.This can also be a cool way to up cycle old shoes, or just a way to pass the time if you are currently bored at home.

Given the current and evolving situation involving COVID-19, please continue to practice social distancing, stay informed about and comply with local guidelines, and we look forward to working out together someday soon. Kevin Hart wants to motivate an entire city to get healthy, so with the help of David Dobrik, they put out a call for over 1,000 fans to meet up for a community fitness event. The third season of What The Fit starring Kevin Hart follows Kevin and a new squad of famous friends as they continue to inspire the world to work out. They\u2019ll take on the courts of the Harlem Globetrotters, organize a community workout for the entire city, and keep in step with a high school marching band. How much success they\u2019ll have with any of these things is up for debate, but one thing they\u2019ve proved time and time again, is that nothing is too bold, too outrageous or too ridiculous for Kevin and his guests if it can get the world on its feet.FOLLOW THE FUNNY:Facebook\u25b6 http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-FBTwitter\u25b6 http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-TWInstagram\u25b6 http://bit.ly/LOLNetwork-IGYouTube\u25b6 https://www.youtube.com/user/HartBeat...Snapchat\u25b6 LOLNetworkOfficial Website\u25b6 http://www.laughoutloud.com Laugh Out Loud is a comedy brand and multi-platform network founded by the world\u2019s top comedian Kevin Hart.
