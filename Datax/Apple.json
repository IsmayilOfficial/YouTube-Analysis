Only on Apple Music: https://apple.co/givemefutureIn March 2016, following the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, electronic dance music trio Major Lazer made history, becoming one of the first major American acts to play in the communist state. Unsure how their descent on Havana would be received and hoping to reach a few tens of thousands, the epic concert unexpectedly drew in close to half a million fans. Much more than a garden variety music film, \u201cGive Me Future\u201d begins as a behind-the-scenes look at the historic concert and evolves into a masterful exploration of Cuba\u2019s inspirational youth movement and its ingenious DIY information culture. Capturing exhilarating performance footage and authentic stories highlighting the country\u2019s cultural growth and desire for inclusion in the global community, director Austin Peters conjures a transcendent, rhythm-laced depiction of the powerful catalysts driving a country on the brink of change.",

Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives will be available exclusively via Apple Music starting on October 3.Listen to the film's soundtrack on Apple Music: http://apple.co/CliveSoundtrackMore than mere biography, The Soundtrack of Our Lives is a guided tour of cultural revolution from the \u201960s to the rise of hip- hop, led by a man who consistently caught the next wave before everyone else\u2014if he didn\u2019t just create the wave himself. Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, Simon & Garfunkel, Santana, Miles Davis, Billy Joel, Barry Manilow, Patti Smith, The Grateful Dead, Kenny G, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Sean Combs, Alicia Keys: even a partial list does not do justice to the incredible range of performers Davis discovered, mentored, or oversaw during his career. Many of them are here, in both archival footage and contemporary interviews, to attest to Davis\u2019s singular talent, blessed life, and how much work went into one to create the other. In Aretha\u2019s words, Davis is \u201cthe greatest record man of all time,\u201d and The Soundtrack of Our Lives is definitive, ceaselessly entertaining proof.",
