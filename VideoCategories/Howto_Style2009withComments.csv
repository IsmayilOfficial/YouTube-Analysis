kcqDk0F_5CQUm," I still don't know how to wear sweater dresses...
Hangers!  Hangers!  Hangers!

Since when did Pringle start using M&S hangers?

Even QVC uses uniformly plain hangers!
She showed me 2 sweat dresses I would never wear and the one she is wearing I would wear but with a tank underneath. It's a tad bit too low cut in the front for me. No accessorizing here or shoes---I think I know what I would wear with it anyway.

Here's a challenge for you, pause it on a certain Pokemon you choose
This was made around the 4th generation , therefore, not including the 5th one.
Everything up to gen 4 is included though.. I like the new gens because they were memorable and had a good story (especially black/white). If you don't like them, play it, and don't think too much of the new pokemon themselves. (My first pokemon was leaf green, by the way.)
got scyther
clefairy,rapidash,kangaskan,espeon,tailow,snorunt
no it is all pokemon in 6 seconds
Ninetails
Colbat
actually it was 9 sec....
Try pausing an moments and naming the pokemon
Pause six times, whoever you land on that is your new party. 
Mine is:

Venomoth

Muk

Heracross 

Blaziken

Spiritomb

Shiny Girantina
For example my team is:

Weezing

Jynx

Drifblim

Espeon

2: Igglybuff (still reasonable, although I prefer porygon2 for my normal type. 
3: Raikou (SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!)
4: Whiscash (I very rarely ever have water types on my team, even though they're the most common type of pokemon besides normal types i think... weird)
5: Spinda (drunken panda, i'm okay with this. aaaand my final pokemon IS....)
6: Regice (again? o_o)

This was in 2009. And X and Y isn't out.
Pause the video! Whichever Pokemon is on the screen is the Pokemon that will be your best friend on your journey to be the very best like no one ever was!

False, right click video, if using chrome it says stats for nerds. The frame rate ranges from 30 to 33. Plus, 25 fps is not the limit; the soft limit is 29.97 fps whereas the hard limit is around 35 depending on video codecs.
Not really. He stopped at 5 seconds and after that he put up text. So, it was 5 seconds.
Golem
Murkrow
Shedinja
Snorunt
Drifloon
Heatran
You tell him/her to learn some manners and yet you tell him/her to shut up...
That's not all the pokemon
pokemon is for 3 yaer  olds !!!!!11
New betting game: Play this video, guess a Pokemon, pause the video before the five seconds are up, and if you guessed right, you win. 
Bay leaf
Gen 1 to gen 4. This was made in 2009 so gen 5 and 6 were not out yet.
It's implied that you should shut up and learn some manners. And please don't reply, the last thing I want is an argument.
its 9 seconds! ?
the biggest relevance of this video is how sad people can be by failing at simple divisions in math and praising one dude for doing so..
Don't know what's wrong with your eyes, but you'll notice that none of them are. If you want proof, pause the video, and compare the pokemon you got with the sprite images on Bulbapedia.
Psyduck, gengar, heracross, sharpedo, dusklops, and garchomp. Not bad.
LIAR is 8 second not 5
It was made befor black and white

lxx4G2a4vW8,"Thanks! I'm glad you liked the review...and Happy Birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's good for those on a budget. I prefer Maxpedition myself.
@spartanthree8 I have a A.L.I.C.E. mountain pack for all my other gear.
Well I wish they had a back mounted beer cooler.
I like the Coyote Tan...it works in most environments and it's more of an O.D. green.
@spartanthree8 It's more of a day pack really.
@kaizerij Thanks! I like the size of the pack...it's just right.
@jerryboy219 Me too but I had to try them out. MRE's were sold out at the time.
@mandgsurvival It's a 100 ounce bladder from HydraStorm.
@FacelessHunter93 Anytime my friend.
@swansongusa Yes but taller XD
@Thebizzle21 The drag bag? It's the standard size. It will comfortable hold a Barrett M99 no sweat.
@DjUndying1 Yes...you and add a pouch to this thing very easily.
@afd09u4vmn It's holding up really good. I'll be taking it on a camping trip at the end of this month. I'll do a video on it or incorporate it into a tactical shoot video.
@2BeatMaster2 There MOLLE straps are great for attaching knives or other gear.
I like Maxpedition and Voodoo both. Some of the stuff Voodoo makes gets upgraded by customer feed back and so does Maxpedition. I am not a huge fan of Blackhawk but in the end it's personal preference. Like Glock vs Beretta.
@BMW3ICS My survival kit is always a work in progress. This pack was filled for the camping trip . I am also using another pack at the moment but I do really like this pack. I have the water bladder and everything for it now..
I think we're going to fill it with rocks and drag it behind the Hummer
@FacelessHunter93 Not really there are 2 main compartments and a few pockets
@LTCimbulletproof You're kidding right?
Maxpedition is hands down the BEST.
@spartanthree8 VooDoo makes tht Tobago pack that has a lot of room in it. I haven't used one...I prefer a pack with a frame. 
@0JeSuS0134  The Mountain House is a dehydrated camping/survival food from Emergency Essentials and is sold at Wal Mart.
is that the deployment bag next to it if so can u do a quick review thanks im totally gonna subscribe
@clousehu Tes. But it could have been better designed for that though.
@ammosmith ahhhhh ok, kool, im thinking about buying one of these as my primary three day back pack, could it fit all  my gear and clothes
@naru150 is it sad that I'm looking at this video for that reason XD
@naru150 No.
Pretty well. I just had to make sure the items in the bag were fairly flat as to not make a bulge into my back. It has no frame at it were. I was pushing it as far as I could on this trip. Next trip it'll be loaded down with ammo.
I too am highly interested in the Tobago pack.
can this pack hold a 15"" laptop in the main compartment?
@LTCimbulletproof A bit smal. I like something a little bigger. I use this as a day pack or when out in the field I use it for lunch, first aid and water. Not a bad bag.
@ammosmith hmmmmm ok, do u recomend any other packs, within reasonable price?
Nevada....
@falconsfan720 A dedicated pocket for the water bladder, MOLLE points on the pack so you can integrate it onto a vest system. Detachable shoulder straps. And a way to build a vest system out of it so that you can have a total modular system the end user can build a system to suit their mission and needs. Just a thought. Voodoo is always upgrading their stuff.
At a surplus store...it was really inexpensive...it's British Gore Tex.
They're life boat rations. Very compact and total nutrition. As far as heavy...you feel like you ate a brick.
i used this bag in my air-soft war and went a lot through were and tears and sniping players when i was in the mud and trees and still the bag is functional and ready any day!!!
Spyderco sharp maker in an assault pack or B.o.b? You've failed.
Friends ranch
This may seem like a stupid question, but where exactly do you put a hydration pack in this assault pack?
It blew out a Zipper and I still use it but not for anything imortant. Maxpedition is my brand of choice..expensive but tough as nails
Damn what about extra clothes!, judging by ur amount of chow, ull be there for a while
@FacelessHunter93 you can get it on a danish webside
@Skedooch12 I agree. It was a camping trip so space wasn't critical. If I did take them out of the packages I'd use electrical tape to insulate the terminals.
@DICHEADTACTICAL Sweet. I want something that isnt going to fall apart on me, because I tend to beat the hell out of my bad.
It looks like my Maxpedition Falcon II
@ammosmith totally i like to mix and match my gear as well i love maxpedition for the ergonomics of their stuff, but if i want a water bottle holder i would go for the condor over the maxpedition because my bottle holder dosent need to be dynamic but my main pack does, as far as black hawk their 3 day bag that looks like a jan sport day bag is outragous both in price and them thinking they can out do companies like max. and voodo just because their packs say blackhawk on them.
@FacelessHunter93 Dunno. They do a certain production run then when they are out they reorder them from the manufacturer. 
@DICHEADTACTICAL How much of a beating did you put it through? I want to get one as a bushcrafting/day hike pack. Thanks
The Mountain House chows are a meal and once the bag is opened there is no other bags. MREs are a different story.
i have just ordered it very nice :b
Toiletries
@ammosmith  totally i have the dump pouch and its awesome holds all my ar 15 mags real well gor tex lined and has all the features and pockets that the maxpedition m 4 waist pouch has but at half the cost, plus its not like your going in the woods to live indefinately maybe a few years at the most after that your whole way you do things would be changed so if your gear failed on you it wouldn't really matter anyways but i doubt that anything from voodo would fail at all.
have some gear with your food ha ha nice vid
I agree 100%.
How is it holding up?
The 'ol bucket trick eh?  lol  Thanks for the reply and all the great videos!  I've been looking for a good day pack and this seemed to fill the bill.  Without the dedicated pocket I'm not so sure. Looks like a great little pack tho.  Can't beat it at the price!
Now what pack is this one? Did you say its a voodoo pack? I like the pack looks great and would have enough room to make a 72 hour pack. Great video.
Where did you get the rain gear?
@ammosmith how do u think it could be better? just wondering im considering
 this pack
 
Have you ever considered breaking your meals down to get more space?
Where does the water bladder or hydration system go?
i wanted to attach a sleeping bag sack... do u think i can?
lol
Hmm.... extra space... more batteries and duct tape
What's with all the batteries?  I must have missed something.
Those were brought for a test. They are OK..but you're right...there are better alternatives. with less sodium and other crap.
No medical? this isn't even serious lol
does it really matter what brand? or is it just the backpack it self i just ordered one from a different site.
It is small. Not a pack for long excursions. They make other packs but not larger in this configuration.
LOL you are a funny man. great humor
Theres a bar that has 3600 calories! Damn! The max I thought was the Big 100 Colossal Bars (you can google it, contains around 400 calories). Whata mean its heavy on the stomach too?
Man to me seeing you putting all that stuff in this backpack is like a Magic trick because i stay thinking how can you fit all that in that little Bag.

I really like the Bag am thinking of Buying one would you still recommend it or if not witch one would you say.

Thanks 
I not only had toilet paper but a 5 gallon bucket with a toilet seat on it. The pack is ""hydration compatable"" but you're right...any pack is. This one doesn't have a dedicate campartment. The Maxpedition ones does though.
3 letters MRE
No these are the ones I get at Wal-Mart in the camping section. They are quite good actually. Better than I expected. The main meals are listed as 2 servings on the back. I may need to do a review on these meals. There are available too 3600 calorie nutrition bars...they are tasty but very heavy on the stomach. I have been focused on ammunition but I think I will do some on bug out gear and gunsmithing too.
With all that food you forgot 1 important item.......toilet paper!!  twigs don't work so well!

According to Voodoo that pack is hydration bladder compatible.  What do you do?  Stuff a bladder in one of the pockets?  If thats the case, any pack is hydration compatible.
lol I know what you mean about the trouble finding modern pouches for the older ammo.  Ive been trying to find some ammo pouches that will work with the surplus military LBV`s that would hold stripper clips of 7.62x54R rounds.  Only thing I found is reproduction russian ammo pouches.  But I do like the look of the pack though and like what can be put in it.
@ammosmith lol of course i'm kidding, there's nothing racist about this video. would you recommend this for a bugout bag? 
i like the garand clip deal. I was looking at a small molly dump bag to put on my LC-2 gear. in theory it looks good i'll have to try it though.
nice pack. are you off to a picnic. all u have is food and batterys. LOL
@godfather40p They are Israeli Galil boots. I got them for $20. I wore them out...and I want another pair...BAD!
what is a man without fresh socks? haha
bought  my kid three backpacks, 200 bucks total, they all broke after two months or so, then I got him a monsoon gearslinger, flawless construction, never had any problems with it, except the fact that its made in Taiwan :(
So that black bag laying there can you attach it to this pack?
lol i got one .. and with my tent and sleeping mat it looks rediculis .. but all and all i love it.. but i wish i would of bought it from a beter company  as of cheper the dirt..  
Excuse me. You said that the Mountain House dried food is 2 servings.  What would you recommend serving wise?Do they come in any other serving sizes? Are they good?
Please don't litter. Carry in, carry out.
i think its great gear for the money not everybody has 400 dollars to drop on just a bag.
I notice a VERY common problem  preppers make when packing. They always seem to pack way too much food and not enough water. You can only last 3 days without water and a lot longer without food. You have a water filtration system which is good but what if you cant find a water source. They say you would use a gallon of water per day I am sure you could go with alittle less depending on the weather and how much you exert yourself bit I think you have way more then 3 days worth of food there plus I believe you need water to prepare those meals! I would sub it out for some water for sure.
After looking at a couple other venders websites, I gave Voodoo a call.  Apparently there is another velcro pocket on the back and a pull tab, near the 2 small D rings, that opens up where you could put a bladder.  I imagine that you can run a para cord though the D rings and the bladder to keep it from collapsing on itself.  So, I bought it and a 3 liter bladder for over half the price of the other vender!  Thanks for reviewing this product.!
let me start by saying this is a great video deff better than 90% of reviews out there. but i did notice you have 8 freeze dried meals and a water filter, but no water container (i.e. canteen/bladder) and no stove or cooking device. im sure you could make a fire but if your going for a tactical adv. why not use a small propane jet stove. i would have also liked to see at least one pouch added using the MOLLE straps just to show how it handles the weight and showing size.  
I noticed you have a deployment bag next to you. Is that the normal one or the extra large deployment bag? also did you do a review on that one as well? Good review on the assault III though. 
ok so im really confused, if anyone can help me...i really want to get this bag, but i have been told to beware of airsoft knockoffs...  i have seen this pack made by vodoo tactical, condor, and i have even heard that maxpedition makes them...i also noticed that sometimes i have seen these bags with four strips of molle webbing on the lower back pouch and black plastic pieces..and i have seen these bags with 2 strips of molle webbing on the lower back pouch with bag color matching plastic pieces
Eatting all that mountain house is gonna kill your kidneys man. There are better options out there that wont kill you
Do they offer any other serving sizes than 2 servings? You said they fill you up bad, so I'd rather have a 1 serving, do they make those? How about 4 servings? What would you recommend serving wise?
sorry dude but who sold you that water filter? Iodine works great (as long as you don't have tyroid issues) Boiling is the only 100 percent effective way to kill critters and straining w/ a bandana will get rid of all the funky floaters. Otherwise a great review.

8x7Ta89QLo4,"Christina Aguilera and Amy Winehouse were the reasons why the sound of the 1950´s/1960´s became popular again, as they were the first artists that really brought back the real soul sound. They also had the emotional lyrics and the vocal talent to back it up . ""Back To Basics"" and ""Back To Black"" were the best albums from 2006, in my opinion. Christina Aguilera was always one step ahead of other pop stars, and still to this day she is still very creative. In my opinion ""Back To Basics"" was her best album and era. Vocally she were in her prime here and she also looked stunning. :)

Can't you believe this song is 13 years old? Who's listening to this in October 2019?
That opening riff is so impressive and iconic
she is still one of the best vocalist out there whether you like her voice or not..
Such an underrated music video! This is honestly the best era for her musically and visually! Everything clicked perfectly. She looked amazing, sounded amazing and she was happy during this era.
Easily her best era. She was at her peak creativity. The way she combined the look of the 1940s blonde bombshell with the sounds, old jazz/blues samples, cabaret-style singing. All of it is just ?
She's so pretty it makes me sick
This album deserved to have won the Grammy's album of the year.
why nobody sings like this anymore(
A voice like that even Aretha said do you’re thing honey
Gigantic voice and talent inside a little body!
Chritina Aguilera  she is always the beauty best singer
CHRISTINA AGUILERA A TRUE POWERHOUSE VOCALISTS SONGWRITER,  ACTRESS MUSICIAN
We need a comeback Christina.
who else’s favourite bit is “do your thing honey” ?
1:36 Does anyone else beside me find the shoes wearing part very sastiying ?
""Ain't No Other Man""

Do your thang honey!
I missed her beautiful natural lips...
I loved the ""Back to Basics"" era. Christina Aguilera has such a powerful and versatile voice.
THIS YOUNG LADY IS A TRUE 
POWER HOUSE AND DEDICATED TO HER CRAFT & AN AMAZING W/ VOCAL RANGES FROM A, B, C, TO Z
Best Popstar of all Time! She is definition of pop history
Just imagine for a split second that egos didn't exist and she did a sing off with Gaga ?
This song is so underrated
She looks like Marilyn Monroe
She's so freaking professional in this video. The eyes, the lips, the timming.. Such a great thing to watch!
Christina, one gorgeous beautiful woman and one of the best voices in modern music history. She is the full package.
ATÉ QUE ENFIM ACHEI A MÚSICA QUE AQUELE CARA DO ÍDOLOS TAVA CANTANDO HAUAHAUAH
DJ Premier, a hip hop legend, worked with her as a producer for this Grammy winning song. Da respect is humongous
my self brought me here!
""Back To Basics was her last successful album"" who cares, I still love her
This was her peak in my opinion, peak soul peak style, she’ll never top this.
Christina Aguilera is SUCH a beautiful, powerful entity. She NEEDS to make a comeback!
Who's here for 2020? ??
I want to see her do jazz. Just one song at least. I bet she would just kick ass with it! Actually maybe every genre she should try.... Her voice is just that amazing!
Ídolos 2012 Brasil !
She so sassy love her attitude my fav wemon
Let’s get 100M views for this Grammy winner song, fighters.
Xtina is the original petite diva.. most powerhouses are tall
best female singer in my opinion.
3:19 is her amazing voice effect on me!!???
Came here after Kelly Clarkson cover at the KELLY CLARKSON SHOW. Who else???
0:40 how many of y’all tried to hit that note?
Oh, Por Dios! Qué recuerdos con esta canción, siempre tan hermosa y con un color de voz excelente. La mejor sin duda
The Guy with the Blonde wig who danced on a Wedding Ceremony brought me here!....just to see the Choreography.??
Great songs but this was when Mariah was dominating with the emancipation of mimi. She could have had more success.
2000's music is much better than nowadays, change my mind
She is just sexy period my goodness sexy beautiful lovely sweetness God bless you baby girl  boogie woogie woohoo????????????????.
Doing a retro music style in a modern key was a fantastic idea, this song and its relative album are pieces of art.
Christina aguilera makes me gay
A true trail blazer! She's always been two steps ahead of other pop girls when it comes to musicality and versatility! #QUEEN
She has such a powerful voice
This type of R&B is truly missed
this girl just went to bubble pop to rnb to jazz to country to rock. what can't she do?
I know she always wants to play with her sound but she should have stuck with this. She really came into her own with this sound.   This style suited her big voice so well
I've always loved that Christina has the pipes! No autotune/studio tuning; she's the real deal! ???
2:05 I thought she was saying, ""You got what I want boy, in a wallet."" ???
She is so beautifull
Essa é a música daquele cara que também canta ""Eu quero ser ora você"" naquele programa de cantar que virou meme
Sexy Classic beauty. Hubba hubba ???????
3:08 person who edited forgot to hide the line behind the chair lol
Ídolos 2012 Brazil! Kkkkkk
Kelly show brought me here !
She has one of the most soulful voices out there.
She tore this song up. Do That
Her voice / talent is literally a nuclear weapon that’s why it has a HUGE impact.. absolutely stunning!
This was her best era
LOVE YOUR CHRISTINA AGUILERA ES LA MEJOR TÙ VOZ ES INCOMPARABLE ,INALCANZABLE ERES UNA DE LAS MEJORES NINGUNA COMO TÙ LOVE YOUR .
I love how snappy the choreography in this music video is.
This Song is a Classic!!
10years later still a bop
You got soul, you got class, you got style...look at that ass!!
Listening in December 2019! ??
I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend

I told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense.

Everytime I see you everything starts making sense.
LOVE IT!
This right here is perfection <3 ....pure energy and love
That was good times.
LOS FANS DE JLO METIENDOSE CON QUEENXTINA.. CUANDO ESA INFELIZ SI NO FUESE POR SELENA LA DIFUNTA / ESTUVIESE DANDO EL CULO EN BROXN.. POR FAVOR  SIN PITBULL NO ES NADIE
If I could choose any singing voice as my own it would be Christinas!! ?
Her voice is poison ?? in the hear
She's so pretty
I was 4 yrs old when this came out I remember when my brother put this song on!
She is a real SINGER!
1:37 was so smooth!!!
Christina at her pinnacle of drop.dead.gorgeous.  Jawdroppingly stunning.  Be still my heart.  Woof.
What better way to get into 2020 than listening to this. Glad it was on my recommendations!!!
0:36 
Yes ma'am I saw them red bottoms
this album is my absolute favorite by Xtina alongside with Stripped, because in my opinion it is one of the best romantic albums of all the time if we based on the lyrics and because here vocally she was amazing .I was literally heartbroken when Christina divorced by Jordan , because they really seemed soulmates by the way Christina described their relationship in this album (especially in this song and in tracks like”save me from myself “ and “the right man”).....I am still wondering why they broke up. Anyways as long as she is happy with Matthew , I am happy as well.
Produced by the master DJ PREMIER.
The greatest vocal in this planet
I love this kind of classic style. It looks like the year of Manilyn Monroe
Hottest woman in the world
This album was so underrated
Essa mulher canta de mais Xtina sou fã ?
That voice never gets old, gorgeous!
Oh Lord I miss that years
Ain't no other voice like you Christina Aguilera 
72M views huh 
She got the the voice, the moves & the look. 

Human of our Generation
I love her in this 50’s style era man
the classiest dirty song
The greatest nostalgia with this one.
Back to Basic was my inspiration before Lana Del Rey
NO ONE CAN EVER PULL OFF THIS SONG, ever! Not in this generations of new female (singers?)
I met a man that drives me crazy ?? and he deserves this song ???
And here we have Christina showing everyone she was the first to wear that blond wig with the fringe that everyone thought she stole form gaga! It's also the wig that gaga wears again on the front cover of ""Artpop""! But take us back to 2006 and Christina wore it first! Just saying! As soon as I saw the cover to ""Artpop"" I thought ""Pathetic""!
Didnt realize how good a roseroyce was back when i first heard this song when it was new being aired over and over on MTV
CHRISTINA A HAS ONE AMAZING RHYTHM SECTION OF HORNS
I just wanna know what exact hair color this isss so I can get it ?
Still amazing ??
I loved the ""baby jane"" era. Christina definitely delivered with this concept. The whole 1920's-1940's theme was genius. She was obviously inspired by ottis redding, etta james, Billie holiday, ella Fitzgerald and all those other african american blues singers.
Wy am i the only one here after 9 fast 10 years later ??i miss so much cristina and this tipe of music ??
???? 
 how many of us still listen to this in 2020 march 
 This voice is fabulous 
 1:35 ?? 
Her songs are beautiful and timeless!!
Christina Aguilera
""Ain't No Other Man""
Back To Basics
RCA Records [CC] 2006
This was her best album 
Happy 10 year anniversary
Who’s in xtina marathon ?
Imagine someone in the 40s having a voice like this omg ???
I didn't know that this was on the same album as Candyman until I had Googled it I love both of these songs and so I am going to buy this on Amazon
Back to basics album  still my favorite than liberation
My favorite scene is in the dressing room. And I love her outfit there the most as well.
Dedicated to the man I keep praying to spend the rest of my life with and someday, we will John 3:16-21, the whole scene and make a home that is just ours.
One of my favourite songs!!!!! 
Christinas vocals are amazing. We are in 2020 and I think she has one of the best voices in the music industry. Also I love BABY JANE!!!!!!!  :)
I miss this kind of pop music.  There are a couple of good artists nowadays but this was back when you HAD to have talent to be a star.
0:30, 0:31, 0:37 The Way A Hero Appears
Love island anyone¿
To bad the  90s and early 2000s music ened. This is when music was still good.
I LOVE YOU
Christina is one unique artist... I feel like she embodies every ""Successful Blonde"" throughout history... She can give the old Hollywood glamour, beauty, essence, and sexiness of Marilyn Monroe... Then she can give you the edgy provocativeness of Madonna like in ""Not Myself Tonight""... To the teen pop sensations in which we were first introduced to her along with Britney Spears... All while possessing a voice that allows her to stand at a mic and belt out James Brown's ""This is a Man's World""... The girl is IT ppl!!!!
this is the Xtina Aguilera i miss!
I could feel it from the start love Xtina,
 Couldn’t stand to be apart Xtina .
I will NEVERRR GET OVER THIS SONG??????
I remembered how mesmerized I got when I saw this MV on MTV back then, my favorite right away, Miss the old times, because if this was on my TV these days it would get blurred at almost every scene or even cut out.
great era in music..so much choice in artists and they were all great! bring back the 2000's :(
Is this the damn whole thing they've cut it down to pieces that play on the radio all the time!! ??????? I've no idea about this!!! ????????? Man!!! This is hilarious!!
There's no signer out there till this era, with that kind of hot body. Omg ??
I,m an old gay man who loves the olde’s , Dina, Billie, Della, and to meany others to list , except I have to add Christina Aguilera, she is a talent that will be remembered for her amassing gift .
I didn’t appreciate this album when it first came out because it just wasn’t my type of music but my taste has definitely changed and I now think this album is genius. I honestly think this era was her best work and it suited her so well
Am I the only one that thinks this song sounds like it could have been in Burlesque?
Pushed out of the industry simply because she was experimenting with sound
o meme do garoto brasileiro no idolos
I Miss this Christina
Best album ?
I agree.  Christina Auilera has to be one of the most underrated singers ever!  Love her!
she's actually a living Barbie doll, I'm convinced
I couldn’t stopped watch her beautiful curly blond hair ??
""Do your thing honey...""
My dream will be a Back To Basics Vol. 2
she's the kinda white girl that gets invited to the cookout??
I always ?? love and miss the 2000s music and still do not have the music from the 2010s and still listen to Christina music for life
I love that opening riff part
2018 Brasil ?
The production level, value and beats on this album ??????
Just do your thang honey!

I could feel it from the start,
Couldn't stand to be apart.
I have been looking for this song ?????
2020 baby still here
I can't be the only one listening to this in 2019.
I love how she pushes away the alfa male sitting on the chair at 3.13 <3
My dad showed me this when I was in 6th grade and I lost my mind. so incredible.
She was my everything love the vintagenesss
Directors: christina wich outfit do you want in the clip?

Christina: yes!
Produced by DJ Premier, yeah look it up
2:27 Whatever happened to baby Jane?
make up: on point 
outfits: on point.
voice: on point
The fact that she was 26 years old here!
Xtina looks so gorgeous here!
I love this very song by Christina Aguilera. This song is as soulful and propelling as a Stevie Wonder or an Aretha Franklin song.
Miss.....
Vanjie <3
christina is the better vocalist, as britney is a better performer.
A Loving Arms remix üt?sebb ?
They always played this song on the Peter Piper Pizzas roller coaster
Still listening to it 2019
Omg i still love this song so much ive allways remembered the beginning of the music video
Christina Aguilera is the queen.
¡El mejor disco de Christina Aguilera! Excelente producción.
to this day I'm still goddamn obsessed with her second look (the lingerie outfit)
Oh and my man ?????this song explains him perfectly.
I honestly think, ""Ain't No Other Man"" & ""Here To Stay"" are her best songs from her TRL-MTV HOLLYWOOD ERA.
WHAT A PERFORMANCE!! THAT GIRL CAN SING!
The ad for this made me lose Whamageddon :(
Oh why can’t style turn back to class. The clothes are fabulous ????
""Do your thing, Honey!""
Hey that @djpremier sound is on lock! Get it!
When Christina Aguilera heard this beat she hated it and didn't want to do the song. 
??? lovin this song more than ever.
Avery Wilson just reminded that I love this song!!!
CLÁSSICO XTINA
We need Xtina with this cabaret style
I find it funny that this song came out before the movie Burlesque did and it has that same sort of vibe. Hahaha
2019 and still getting motivated by this song. I love her voice, her energy, her charisma, I swear. There isn't gonna be another Christina Aguilera ever again in this world or the next.
this was /the/ song when i was a child. still is absolutely  amazing
Diane Vergoza should sing this on Idol PH
this video turned me gay.
2:01 Katy Perry?
Hey!
Do your thang, honey!

I could feel it from the start
She is the Queen ?? Te Amo
I swear in every Christina video she’s always wearing louboutons , all about the detail??
Her album 'Back to Basics' is so full of soul, a real masterpiece, every song brings a lot of meaninfull emotion songs. The beats, the looks, the lyrics is so mindblowing. Could never get tired of it. Xtina rocks!!
This takes me back to when Burlesque first came out?? Anyone else here that can relate??
Still ma fave through the years.
Wonderfull ? She's divine!
Where’s the guy that comments the lyrics to songs?!?
I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW MAN!!!
fall in Line
Remindes me of Bourlesque!!??
Thiago Delfino.
Who else wish she sung this in Burlesque
Why do not you christina continue the 50's making songs?:o
Remember when i was watching this capolavoro on mtv
she has some soul way deep down!!!
Go girl yes YYYYeeeesss,,,,,
Ugh, this is so perfect.  ????
This album was very underrated..
This Album Will Never Get Old #Timeless???? #BringThisBack?
Cool I have to CD
1:27song starts at 0:27 and second verse at 1:49
This style suits her so muchh!
No one sings like Christina. Very talented. She can be a diva but if you looked and sounded like her, you would be a little cocky too.
10 years for this video! Wow, I'm old...
MISS VANJIEE, MIS VANJIE, MISS.......VANJIEE
Ain't no other woman like you Xtina!!
And now it’s the Twenties again :)
She comes close to Whitney Houston. I love Christina Aguilera
Such an excellent talented singer and so incredibly hot, sexy and beautiful at the same time!!!
Her ""Back to basics"" album rocked!
Fantastic idea! Combining 30's style with modern day music.
Only 69M views... this is an insult to music itself.
As anyone thought of Christina being Marilyn
Miss vanjie
MISS VANJIE
MISSS VAAAAANJIEEEE
I'm just speechless!
OMGGGGG....December 2018!!?!!??
Quem veio pelo menino do Ídolos? ?
This is the iconic Christina Aguilera I grew up with. The first song I ever heard from her was Genie in a Bottle. After that she just kept getting better.
? Ain't No Other Christina ?
This song is romantic and dedicated to her husband. They’re now divorced.
I love this song.. Just had to say even after all these years
They gotta release this in HD omg it’s would be awesome ??
Can't believe this was ten years ago. She was still relevant here. Miss xtina
premo on breakfast club broughtn me here!
I loved the Back to Basics era of Christina. I wasn’t feeling her Dirrty phase and was glad to see her class it up again.
I want retro clothes like this in the video
Nobody's gonna talk about the Jim crow picture on the wall at 2:43?
Sexiest woman ever
THE AMAZING 

MS. CHRISTINA AGUILERA 
OMg I remember how much I loved the outfit in this video
OK, here's the thing: you should know when to end the damn thing!
I just love your jazZy side legendtina ??
I loved this phase of Christina's career
Preemo is behind this
This is how a chest VOICE is put to  is used and sing beautifully.... It has good dramatic contrast,  good pitch and more importantly she uses every possible faculty including ""Frying"" to make the song and singing unique & pleasing.....!
What fish was singing the song in a movie? Love her forever <3
This Song reminds me of  4th Impact <3
She in my opinion is the greatest vocalist in the world!!!!
TELL MAX I'M ON MY WAY OUT THE DOOR I CALL THE MGR & CRIME CHECK IF I DON'T MAKE DOWNSTAIRS NOW I'M ON MY WAY
OUT THE DOOR NOW
Baby Jane ?
Why can’t she release music as good as this again? I mean, I liked Liberation, but it’s not iconic :(
Thank U Preem for this beat.GOAT
I remember when a friend asked me if I had heard of Christina A. and I said all I know about her was that she was a teen from the Mickey Mouse Club and NO I did not listen to teen pop music. She bought me this CD and I was hooked! Went out and bought another one. This was my one of my favorites.  1st time seeing the video. Sexy, powerful songstress.
ANOTHER GREAT & FABULOUS SONGBIRD

There is no way C.Aguilera will ever be at J.Kimmel's mean tweets.
She is the best at everything she does.Even for just existing
Can’t believe this song is produced by Dj Premier. This is amazing, he’s such a good producer.
Listening to #Classics May 13th #2019 at 3:45am #teamXtina #Fighter #Legendary #Icon #Queen Who Own's the throne?? You do Mommy.. What song is that from ?
Christina always looks amazing but her looks in this video are snatched! I love it! ?????? Love how this video is based on the 1920s, that’s the decade vibes it gave me from first hearing it
This is my everyday song to work and all around town ????????
I love it totally,,

Video Vanguard Award 2019
ariana grande loved this song so much she remade it check it out xD

I'm here to clean my eyes after seeing Xtina on Jimmy Fallon ( or Kimmel idk)
She's the best! Her voice & music from 200.. years sounds better than 90% of 2016' shit)
Her voice is just, stunning
Even the beat of this song screams 'EPIC'
I wish Christina knew how beautiful she was before all that plastic surgery. Especially in the Candyman era ??
Man if every woman could emulate this there would be no more unhappy men!
I was 6 when this came out and I would sing this in school all the time and the teachers would throw books and the desk at me and call my mom oh memories :)
#12yearsofBackToBasics today and it still feels so on point. Best album. <3
""ain't no other girl that can stand up next to you ain't no other girl on the planet does what you do you're the kinda girl a guy finds in a blue moon you got soul you got class you got style you're bad a""...

Her and Adele are amazing.!!!!!!!
I remember when this song first came out.
Tão linda ??????????
I love Christina
That 60s vibe ??
I wouldn't mind if she dumped the modern day music and went back to the basics. Her best album ever!! The rest is good too, but it's just not doing it for her anymore. Still love her!
Such a good video to watch on mute. Love the outfits and the barber shop theme but can't bear to hear her voice lol!

Ooo she went off on that last chorus! Forgot how amazing this was
Ain't No Other Man would ever wanna go out nor perform duets with you!
Not many can sing like her. I love Britney but you just can't put these two in the same category.Christina can sing like anything and Britney is more an entertainer. 
Someone in november 2018?
Throughout the video she looked so so so stunning in all those different styles

Stop the whole Britney and Christina thing it's very old and boring it needs to end. There both great at what they do. Christina awesome performer and Britney a really great entertainer both there music is great. There Both Humans neither one of them is perfect they both have had there ups and downs in there career. Right now there both in a good place in there place. They never talk bad about each other and about other people. So why are we talking about them it not right we have no right talking we don't know there life's to talk about them and even if we did know about there life's it still would be wrong to talk bad about them

Terminator salvation el ultimo capitulo en 2009 o hace apenas 10 años recuerdo muy bien a Cristina Aguilera gritándonos y animándonos a reconstruir nuestro mundo  diciéndonos el voz alta: las maquinas creen que no podemos ganar, la maquina tambien cree que no atacaremos el corazon mismo de Skynet y aqui estamos en el precipicio de la ultima batalla para ya acabar con esta larga y espantosa guerra y esta misma noche recuperaremos nuestro mundo.
Miss Vanjie
Damn she is fine. Still, her and Britney was the biggest fight over the 00's and Britney won, but she still deserves attention from songs like this. She is simply beautiful and a fantastic singer!

2020 presente
her finest era
I love the way she sings, she rocks!
I think a lot of modern songs are more about sounding ear pleasing. My own music is like this, I use what I have, but Christina not only had a great voice, but I think she was skilled too. I wish I would have been taught how to sing properly... I don't even know if Christina was taught, but I think maybe she was, and I think if I had been taught how to sing properly, and if I had trained my voice and learnt to be skilled I think I could have been a really good singer.
2019?????
Alguien sabe cual es el tema de la intro?
Durma beeeem
Kalorie vs Vanessa, both gave me life but in the end kalorie gave me so much more life!
i still havent heard anyone  nail that 25 note run in the intro. thats why she is a legend. i mean i bet tori kelly could easily but stil there is only one xtina goddess who can nail it and that is her

After Ariana Grande's, Girls Aloud's and Beyonce's songs and NOW CRISTINA AGUILERA!! Only 4th impact can do this. They wanted to get tired unlike other performers.
I too would love for her to a complete Jazz album! She has the baddest range and voice i have heard, she is AWESOME!!!

would make a great album, doing a andrews sisters revival
this album will forever be one of my absolute favourites. The vibes. The voice. The everything.
I NEARLY DIED LISTENING TO THIS SONG AS A BUMBLE BEE FLEW INTO MY THROAT lol
I remember the time,when I was eleven years old and my English Teacher humiliated me just because I didn't who was Aguilera.I'm triggered!!!
I want to do this at my wedding. To cute. It's exactly how I feel.
One of my favorites from her! Probably because I am obsessed with both the pin up and old Hollywood glam style! Every outfit on point plus it's catchy as hell
LOVE THIS SONGGGGGGGG
This is my favorite music video from Xtina!??? Her voice, the lyrics, the outfits, the story... everything is perfect!??
That Voice Though!!!! gives me chills
?????????????????????????
?????? CHRITINA
???!
Liza got me hooked on this from watching her musically
I've been lookin for a modern day Mozart.... such a fool..... it lives in you

4th impact brout me here

Honey where you get dat voice from ????

Come back Christina ??
This music video of her is underrated !!! 
Why almost of Xtina videos are underrated compare with the others .?
The vintage look fits her so well.I think she should been born in the 40's or 50's
I hope someday  I can sing this for someone!
This reminds me of a little mix song
Liza Koshy brought me here XD
sucha  a great voice and I always loved this video, all the beautiful people of color that surround her.  She would have stuck out like a sore thumb even back then as all the clubs that have vdocalists like this were not white, xtina has always been that exception.  Such a soulful voice!
cant wait to see more people harass me more pay back coming in the future lol
¡#Xtina The More Beautiful!
2017 ?
When Baby Jane was on fire.
She is amazing!
Who's watching this 2017?

I looked up Christina Aguilera HEEEEEYY and I found it.
Só vim mesmo por causa do menino do Ídolos ?

do do your thing honey lol
I feel like even if you don't like one of her songs by the middle you'll be singing along.
Such an AMAZING voice and pretty face. She cheapens her image by being 1/2 dressed in every video. Girls with no talent need to do that.
SHE GOTS SOUL....LOTS. THEN THAT VOICE.  I  ADORE.
Who else watching this and thinking about Ariana's Grande old school video with Misha???#Arianators
The song that I will not get tired to listen!!
this song is good for any singing competition.
I've always thought that Christina was better then Brittany, a much better voice. 
How The Hell can Xtina dance in those heels????????????????????
LOVE the video :D
this should be in burlesques 
she is awesome. at 3:45 in the video she hits a note that is unreal. Wow
#art

I want more songs like this Xtina!
I was born in 2003, and I'm going through ""nostalgic"" songs ^-^ Anyone else?
You're voice is amazing! Miss this kind of music! ?

""C'mon, I hear even more""

I bwl at that.
10:20 - Silent Hill, directed by Quentin Tarantino.
That stare-down with the Hanged Scratcher was epic. He probably saw how you smashed his buddies, and began to wonder ""Is attacking this guy REALLY worth it?""
Love the title on this one :)
Oh, it's still quite possible to get killed.  You really have to learn the timing on the hammer.
Nethack, eh?  I'm actually not familiar with that one, but yeah, if it had controls like these and walls damaged you, I'd be in trouble X)
And for a moment, Silent Hill was Doom
epic stare-down
Aye, it makes the sewers very annoying, making sure the path is clear since the radio doesn't give constant static to let you know.
Question. When did you transition from ""Nice refreshing pauses"" to ""Fare thee well ends""?
@RoahmMythril You know..........they make controllers for PC...
I think i saw mario in the pipes   
?*:.?. o(???)o .?.:*?
the hanged scratcher at the end wanted a showdown =P
Lol it's turtle time dude....  RADICAL
I do play a lot of 3D games, yes.  The problem with the original Silent Hill is you don't have as much control over the camera as other games, and what little you do have, it's hard to find on a keyboard configuration X)  At the time I was recording this, I didn't yet have the Gamebridge, so this was done via an emulator.
At least in the lower-ceilinged access tunnels there's no Hanged Scratchers on the ceiling.
Mine was only $10 at Gamestop.
too true, but we are not all made of money!
