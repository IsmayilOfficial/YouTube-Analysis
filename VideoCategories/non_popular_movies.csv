EVQ7xDSgtI0	Looks like they blew they're entire budget on Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie chan, cause the cgi looks like crap
EVQ7xDSgtI1	Umm.....  Why do I get the feeling that Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger are only in one scene in this entire movie?
EVQ7xDSgtI2	I bet Jacky and Arnold only play a really small part in the first 10 minutes in the movie and will never show up again.
EVQ7xDSgtI3	The fact that it looks kind of bad makes me want to watch it even more
EVQ7xDSgtI4	This was the strangest trailer I've ever seen...... It seems very confused. Wtf?
EVQ7xDSgtI5	Get to the dragon!!
EVQ7xDSgtI6	Audio dubbing? All the audio sounds like voice over.
EVQ7xDSgtI7	The dragon will get Terminated
EVQ7xDSgtI8	this looks like a SNL skit
EVQ7xDSgtI9	Oh this is corny and perfect. I'm gonna watch the hell out of this!
EVQ7xDSgtI10	This trailer was uploaded 2 years ago to a random YouTube channel, so this must be a extremely old project that they just forgot to release
EVQ7xDSgtI11	Watching our heros gating old is so painful
EVQ7xDSgtI12	I don't care how bad the writing or CGI is, Jackie Chan and Arny are together and I'm here for it
EVQ7xDSgtI13	This is a foreign film that was released like 3 years ago under a different title. It is only now being dubbed in English and released in the US
EVQ7xDSgtI14	I'm nominating this for a Razzie just going by the trailer!
EVQ7xDSgtI15	"I'm still recovering from the ""Rough Draft"" trailer... LOL"
EVQ7xDSgtI16	"It's called ""THE MYSTERY OF THE DRAGON SEAL"""
EVQ7xDSgtI17	Man I feel real sad ?....jackie is getting old . I am gonna become depressed when he dies ?. I always was a huge fan since I was 7yrs old
EVQ7xDSgtI18	0:46 Mmmmmmmmmmm..........THE CGI IS VERY WRONG
EVQ7xDSgtI19	"""IT'S SE TAAUUUAAA!!"" :D"
EVQ7xDSgtI20	2 legends and this the best story yall can come up with...meh.....??
EVQ7xDSgtI21	 like when jackie chan and jet li did that fantasy movie together come on ??
EVQ7xDSgtI22	Looks like crap.
EVQ7xDSgtI23	Okay, I'm in.
EVQ7xDSgtI24	When Terminator meets The Monkey King: The Movie!! :p
EVQ7xDSgtI25	Jackie Chan Nostalgia brought me
EVQ7xDSgtI26	Dragon have a corona virus ?
EVQ7xDSgtI27	Please Jackie make a Reboot from one of your old Films ,like Drunken Master ,Snake in the Eagles Shadow ....!
EVQ7xDSgtI28	When you don't have a single actual scenery, invest in good CGI. Please.
EVQ7xDSgtI29	I just watched “The Foreigner” and thought; “Wow Jackie Chan has gotten even better in his old age.” Then I see this trailer. Never mind.
EVQ7xDSgtI30	If this is anything like The Man with the Iron Fists, I think we're in for a good time, no alcohol required
EVQ7xDSgtI31	"SKYNET: ""SENDING T-101 IN 1700."" ?"
EVQ7xDSgtI32	The match up we've been looking for, but 20 years late ?
EVQ7xDSgtI33	The trailer is odd. Is this a child’s movie?
EVQ7xDSgtI34	"""Something is very wrong"". Yeah, it's the dubbing on the damn trailer ?! BTW Arnie looks like Baron von Munchausen. If you have not seen that Terry Gilliam classic yet, I dare you to see it now."
EVQ7xDSgtI35	THE CGI LOOKS AMAZING!!!! IF THIS YEAR WERE 2002!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI36	Looks like it's the sequel to Forbidden Empire with Jason Flemyn which I enjoyed; on Amazon Prime, going to have to see this one.
EVQ7xDSgtI37	Was the first one great? No! but it was a blast and Jason Flemyn looked like he was having fun in it.?
EVQ7xDSgtI38	Escape Plan: The Prequel
EVQ7xDSgtI39	I could of sworn I saw this on syfy channel last year??
EVQ7xDSgtI40	If I was forced to go see this manure in the cinema I’d wear an iron mask with no eye holes. Muck.
EVQ7xDSgtI41	The mid 2000s called; they want their graphics back.
EVQ7xDSgtI42	Wow i remember seeing this trailer in like 2014 ....wtf
EVQ7xDSgtI43	I first thought that the King of France was Chinese. ?
EVQ7xDSgtI44	Jackie Chan, he's old now ?
EVQ7xDSgtI45	Im very confused..this already released and i watch full on facebook..they changed the movie name 3 times..loll
EVQ7xDSgtI46	I saw the exact same trailer from the movie the mystery of the dragon (2018). Can someone explain why
EVQ7xDSgtI47	How come this is for y2020. I already seen this movie last year.
EVQ7xDSgtI48	IM GEEKING OUT OVER HERE!
EVQ7xDSgtI49	Yeah, battlefield earth in the middle ages, this time Travolta leaves and comes swargeneger! ??????
EVQ7xDSgtI50	So I’m guess that Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger are only in the film during an escape attempt in the Tower of London? Maybe a cameo appearance rather than main cast?
EVQ7xDSgtI51	So funny, watched it couple of months ago.
EVQ7xDSgtI52	wtf?! Still going to watch it looks good! :)
EVQ7xDSgtI53	Western civilisation may have just hit its lowest point.
EVQ7xDSgtI54	all these ancient china movie speaking english is making me cringe, c'mon man! its 2020 we prefer subs!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI55	 i dont give a crap if i understood the foreign language or not
EVQ7xDSgtI56	All these comments from great CGI artist.
EVQ7xDSgtI57	The only thing I liked about Kill Bill was Quentin Tarantino's uncompromising vision. This does not have Quentin Tarantino.
EVQ7xDSgtI58	This looks absolutely ridiculous. I can't wait to see it.
EVQ7xDSgtI59	Arnold and Jakie Chan that's awesome
EVQ7xDSgtI60	"Arnold: "" ????? ""!!!"
EVQ7xDSgtI61	I already watched this
EVQ7xDSgtI62	Coming soon to a VHS player near you!
EVQ7xDSgtI63	WTF I watched this movie last year, it's the DRAGON SEAL WTF with Iron mask again, this is the worst
EVQ7xDSgtI64	So funny. Kids movie ?????????????????????
EVQ7xDSgtI65	I love cheesy movies that actually make it to the big screen. MUST SEE for this guy! Everything about this looks like a blast! WHOOOO HOOOOOOO!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI66	Oh dear me I was looking forward to a Jackie Chan and Arnie film and we get this well still waiting lol
EVQ7xDSgtI67	If Sly can be in GoTG, hopefully Chan and Sch can be in GoTG 3!
EVQ7xDSgtI68	It's sounds dubbing ??
EVQ7xDSgtI69	Looks like I'm paying for maverick and Kong vs godzilla this year.
EVQ7xDSgtI70	Wait i alredy watched this movie like a month ago why is the trailer out now? ?
EVQ7xDSgtI71	Great Jackie is back
EVQ7xDSgtI72	This is gonna be fun
EVQ7xDSgtI73	Damn. Thats some good ass CGI for it only being 2020!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI74	Wowww this looks bad. I thought it was a joke for a second lol
EVQ7xDSgtI75	THE ICEMAN COMETH.
EVQ7xDSgtI76	Is this by The Asylum?
EVQ7xDSgtI77	Arnold from Dark Fate is back!
EVQ7xDSgtI78	this looks so bad but i cant wait to watch it!!!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI79	I have seen the movie ???
EVQ7xDSgtI80	Wait, this is for real?
EVQ7xDSgtI81	Did they just decide to put anyone that has a line, in large empty metal room and ADR everything?
EVQ7xDSgtI82	This movie remind me of another Jackie Chan movie called around the world in 80 days. And yeh Mr Arnold was there.
EVQ7xDSgtI83	Ok - so what we take from this trailer is that it has second rate CG, and a third rate script. I think I'll wait for it to appear on free to air TV.
EVQ7xDSgtI84	Doesn’t the background kinda look like a video game?
EVQ7xDSgtI85	trailer was out over 5 months ago????? The Mystery Of The Dragon Seal - Official Trailer (2019) Jackie Chan Movie HD
EVQ7xDSgtI86	The release of Viy 2 in Russia was to be held on 16 August 2018,[6] but subsequently the premiere was postponed to 19 September 2019[7] while pending censorship approval in China.[8] After the completion of the regulation of issues, the film premiered in China on 16 August 2019.[9][2]
EVQ7xDSgtI87	This came out in 2018 didn’t it? Just a different title
EVQ7xDSgtI88	Oooo boy, thats rough
EVQ7xDSgtI89	Jackie and Arnold are probably only in it for the first 5 minutes.
EVQ7xDSgtI90	It is not a tumor!!! ?
EVQ7xDSgtI91	OMG? what a trailer... Then what a movie... no Wait no wait nowai...
EVQ7xDSgtI92	Well good to know arney and jacky are only in one scene of this entire shitfest, I’m in!
EVQ7xDSgtI93	This was potentially a good film, it has a good story. I'm just trying to figure out why you chose to make it a comedy.
EVQ7xDSgtI94	by about 0:31 i had scoffed several times and felt sad and ashamed for the actors involved, thinking this would be a stupid, cheap comedy but then it suddenly became what looked a bit like a decent budget fantasy spectacular! ? 'd   
EVQ7xDSgtI95	#OldManPaxus Rating: ??? ½   .. . .. . . are you sure this trailer is for a movie? and not a computer game?
EVQ7xDSgtI96	Yeah... still gonna watch it
EVQ7xDSgtI97	Arnold as a British man lmao ? okay ?? I’m sold
EVQ7xDSgtI98	teaser came last year!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI99	I believe the original title of this movie is Viy. This is a sequel from the first movie which the lead character/actor is Jason Flemyng.
EVQ7xDSgtI100	I can't wait for this comedy.
EVQ7xDSgtI101	What's the title?? Wheres the imdb page??? I want to see this!!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI102	T-800 & Jackie SHan  Team up?????
EVQ7xDSgtI103	Low budget VFX!!
EVQ7xDSgtI104	WTF?!
EVQ7xDSgtI105	Hahaha finally
EVQ7xDSgtI106	That looks so stupid...  I can't wait to see it
EVQ7xDSgtI107	I wonder if Chris Rock is gonna bitch about this movie not including enough diverse cast members
EVQ7xDSgtI108	Ummmmmm, how bout, no Scott?!
EVQ7xDSgtI109	Wow, it’s 2020 and the shittest films ever are being made. What a time to alive.
EVQ7xDSgtI110	Nice.
EVQ7xDSgtI111	At last...
EVQ7xDSgtI112	The Great Wall 2?
EVQ7xDSgtI113	Arnold start doing westerns
EVQ7xDSgtI114	Omg the CGI is freaking horrific
EVQ7xDSgtI115	Helmet? This is a east end pie
EVQ7xDSgtI116	Do you understand the words that are coming out of their mouths?
EVQ7xDSgtI117	Yeah! Cheese hell movie!
EVQ7xDSgtI118	it has The Forbidden Kingdom vibe
EVQ7xDSgtI119	I can’t tell if Jackie is the main character or not...
EVQ7xDSgtI120	Looks like good corny fun :)
EVQ7xDSgtI121	Gonna watch this for Jackie chan
EVQ7xDSgtI122	OMG...I'm like what the bleep were people thinking? Drugs like that should shared lol.
EVQ7xDSgtI123	Isn’t this movie about 2 years old?
EVQ7xDSgtI124	Already seen the movie and trailer is here yesterday
EVQ7xDSgtI125	This very nice movie..its same movie`` The journey in china?...
EVQ7xDSgtI126	Let off some steam.. Bennett
EVQ7xDSgtI127	Wtf! ?
EVQ7xDSgtI128	WTF?
EVQ7xDSgtI129	jacky never die..
EVQ7xDSgtI130	Incredible...
EVQ7xDSgtI131	I would watch it just to see jackie chan and Arnold
EVQ7xDSgtI132	OMG. MUST. SEE. THIS. NOWWWWW
EVQ7xDSgtI133	"It's like they really really want to show that they're movie use CGI rather than make the CGI looks as real as possible. ""hey look, we have CGI as well you guys :}"""
EVQ7xDSgtI134	Oh dear.
EVQ7xDSgtI135	So the entire movie was shot on a green screen
EVQ7xDSgtI136	Lotta cgi.. do hope this movie is good though 2 great actors
EVQ7xDSgtI137	I have a feeling that jackie chan and Arnold are be in it for small part of the film. The trailer only showed them in the same area.
EVQ7xDSgtI138	Why did they record all the audio in a bathroom?
EVQ7xDSgtI139	Getting some real The Last Airbender vibes
EVQ7xDSgtI140	Everybody get down
EVQ7xDSgtI141	Lord mobiles the movie. The game had better graphics
EVQ7xDSgtI142	The CGI looks horrendous but I just love jackie chan and my action hero arny!! I am watching this.
EVQ7xDSgtI143	Anyone else here for the dragon?
EVQ7xDSgtI144	God that looks awful.
EVQ7xDSgtI145	I wanna see it.
EVQ7xDSgtI146	This looks like a fake trailer that you'd see in Grindhouse
EVQ7xDSgtI147	Be rude not to watch a Jackie chan movie??
EVQ7xDSgtI148	It looks so bad. I cant wait
EVQ7xDSgtI149	Arnold and Jackie look to be the only good thing in this train wreck
EVQ7xDSgtI150	Authentic 1999 CGI!
EVQ7xDSgtI151	Hmm.....I'm only going to watch this because, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan are in the movie. 
EVQ7xDSgtI152	TERRANCE OUT
EVQ7xDSgtI153	People didn't give The Forbidden Kingdom a chance either and that movie was great, I can't wait to see this.
EVQ7xDSgtI154	Arnold is way out of place, im surprised he wasnt like an old barbarian
EVQ7xDSgtI155	Man this will flop bigtime
EVQ7xDSgtI156	this is an old movie
EVQ7xDSgtI157	Looks like a big ol mess.
EVQ7xDSgtI158	Watched it was a good movie
EVQ7xDSgtI159	No. Just no.
EVQ7xDSgtI160	Looks like from 2003
EVQ7xDSgtI161	This movie has been out. Subbed but out. I say subbed but half of it is in English anyway.
EVQ7xDSgtI162	Name dropping Kill Bill won't get me to watch this crap
EVQ7xDSgtI163	So excited
EVQ7xDSgtI164	What a big mustache
EVQ7xDSgtI165	Looks lame
EVQ7xDSgtI166	I am quite hyped to see Arnold and jackie Chan at the big screen together but the cgi make this feel more like a video game over a movie.
EVQ7xDSgtI167	After the DF debacle Arnold can only do bad Chinese movies now.
EVQ7xDSgtI168	The real title of this movie is  viy 2 journey to china, then it was  forbidden empire 2: journey to china, then it was renamed, journey to china: mystery of the dragon seal, then it was renamed Journey to china : mystery of the iron mask, NOW it is THE IRON MASK.... it was released 3 times under the  1st ,2nd and 3rd title since 2018... I have no idea what the producers are smoking to make them forget they have already released this film 2 times
EVQ7xDSgtI169	Reminds me of Forbidden Kingdom but with more crazy stuff going on and humor lol ?.
EVQ7xDSgtI170	What The heck?
EVQ7xDSgtI171	I already watched in last year
EVQ7xDSgtI172	uuuuuuuuuuuooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!! Arnoldd and Jackiiiiiie   nhaaa
EVQ7xDSgtI173	RAZZIE AWARDS 2021 WINNERS ;
EVQ7xDSgtI174	WORST PICTURE
EVQ7xDSgtI175	Wack
EVQ7xDSgtI176	Nope
EVQ7xDSgtI177	Another wheelchair movie
EVQ7xDSgtI178	Reason to watch this : Arnie and Jackie
EVQ7xDSgtI179	A movie starring two of the hardest people to understand.
EVQ7xDSgtI180	Hard pass on this one?
EVQ7xDSgtI181	Don't go below, they are asking for likes. ?
EVQ7xDSgtI182	The animation/special effects pretty much stole the show, but not in a good way, I know they’re in there golden years, and can’t do certain things they used to do, wish they’d turn the special effects down a few notches, let these two legends steal the show not the most colorful dragon I’ve ever seen
EVQ7xDSgtI183	That CGI looks like from 1990´s. What is budget for this movie and how big cut Jackie and Arnold have ? Like WTF it must be like 90%.
EVQ7xDSgtI184	already released in chinese last year
EVQ7xDSgtI185	Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie chan in the same movie?!.. I love it!
EVQ7xDSgtI186	Don't want to see it
EVQ7xDSgtI187	Dragon seal ????
EVQ7xDSgtI188	I love jackie chan
EVQ7xDSgtI189	vai ganhar o oscar nesse ai em...
EVQ7xDSgtI190	I'm only going to sit through this movie for one reason and one reason alone to see Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwarzenegger fight
EVQ7xDSgtI191	Is this a joke?
EVQ7xDSgtI192	Idk about you but for me the bad CGI and ridicolous look actualy make it more intaresting and funny
EVQ7xDSgtI193	I will watch this... after I have seen Cats.
EVQ7xDSgtI194	Why did they change the name of the movie?????
EVQ7xDSgtI195	I saw this trailer like two months ago and the name was different. (I can't remember the other name)
EVQ7xDSgtI196	Ummm....the jury is still out.
EVQ7xDSgtI197	This is unfortunate.
EVQ7xDSgtI198	I will never again watch a Jackie Chan movie ever...Is dude lives in China when the coronavirus breakout.. He didn't donate a single dime to help his people!! Cheap ass Jackie!!
EVQ7xDSgtI199	Jackie Chan? not interested
EVQ7xDSgtI200	The cgi is absolutely disappointing

EVQ7xDSgtI207	a volta dos que não foram
EVQ7xDSgtI208	Looking more like a video game, graphics sucks
EVQ7xDSgtI209	Okay.............
EVQ7xDSgtI210	I thought jackie chan died at the age of 63
EVQ7xDSgtI211	WTF is that CGI?
EVQ7xDSgtI212	Is this a comedy?
EVQ7xDSgtI213	This is a SEQUEL to a 2014 movie called Forbidden Kingdom
EVQ7xDSgtI214	jackie chan  is cool.
EVQ7xDSgtI215	Horrível
EVQ7xDSgtI216	?????? ??? ???? ????
EVQ7xDSgtI217	"Why, why, is this a thing? Why, why, does this have 1.8k likes to 192 dislikes? I kept waiting for the deep fake reveal but it never came! The people that paid to get this made prove that some people have too much money. It's like one step up from ""burn it with fire""."
EVQ7xDSgtI218	Just looks like a kids movie so I'll pass on criticising it.
EVQ7xDSgtI219	Very nice video trailer
EVQ7xDSgtI220	#someinteresting
EVQ7xDSgtI221	Ga ada pemain lain yg cocok gitu
EVQ7xDSgtI222	do they have asian version when english people speak in english and chinese people speak in chinese and jackie chan speak in english when he talking with english people and speak in chinese when he talk with chinese people?
EVQ7xDSgtI223	why not throw in stallone as a pirate and jet li as master roshi
EVQ7xDSgtI224	amazing video
EVQ7xDSgtI225	why is the adr so bad?
EVQ7xDSgtI226	Viy 2
EVQ7xDSgtI227	Not able to accept the fact, Both of my childhood hero's acted together in crappy movie :(
EVQ7xDSgtI228	All posters here are brainless and nonsense
EVQ7xDSgtI229	Too bad Steve Coogan isn't here to travel the globe.
EVQ7xDSgtI230	Looks like it could be a kids movie Arnold bringing comedy ?
EVQ7xDSgtI231	very good
EVQ7xDSgtI232	This movie can only be made better if they had Nic Cage in it. I would pay to see it over and over again for Nic Cage. God, I love him!!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI233	This. Looks. Awful.
EVQ7xDSgtI234	What century was this movie made???
EVQ7xDSgtI235	why no funny trailer is jaki movie ??
EVQ7xDSgtI236	?Ty!
EVQ7xDSgtI237	It looks DREADFUL!???? I dont get it, is it meant to look bad? Like a joke???
EVQ7xDSgtI238	Anything with Jackie Chan.... take my money!!!??
EVQ7xDSgtI239	Definitely going to watch that on my birthday ?
EVQ7xDSgtI240	awesome new video game.
EVQ7xDSgtI241	Geez enough with the 70 year olds making action movies like they're still in their 30's
EVQ7xDSgtI242	amazingly epic
EVQ7xDSgtI243	Very old movie
EVQ7xDSgtI244	CGI is crap
EVQ7xDSgtI245	bad movie.....
EVQ7xDSgtI246	Looks fun but... cgi looks crap.
EVQ7xDSgtI247	Looks terrible. So terrible that I might actually watch it out of curiosity
EVQ7xDSgtI248	"Looks low budget, not for me. It’s 2020 and the Norwegian series ""Ragnarok"" has better CGI. Shame."
EVQ7xDSgtI249	Jackie and Arnold will only have well payed cameos to market the film to western audiences. It's the sequel to Forbidden Kingdom (Viy). A russian film from 2014. This film will be a Russian and Chinese co-production. That's why the effects aren't blockbuster like, but still not really bad. A lot of chinese and russian films are quite watchable with passable effects.
EVQ7xDSgtI250	That's terrible.
EVQ7xDSgtI251	https://youtu.be/bCcxtTWUM30
EVQ7xDSgtI252	I still think they need more Jackie Chan and Schwarzenegger to cover up the bad acting and CGI.
EVQ7xDSgtI253	12:28:00 AM
EVQ7xDSgtI254	Hey Raiden Called,he wants his hat back
EVQ7xDSgtI255	Another chinese produced film that tries hard to be Hollywood. Hard pass. Sorry Arnold and Jackie you guys are still my heroes.
EVQ7xDSgtI256	This looks terrible.......just, why ?
EVQ7xDSgtI257	Kk
EVQ7xDSgtI258	Going straight to dvd
EVQ7xDSgtI259	CGI movies sucks!!!
EVQ7xDSgtI260	Arnold Schwarzenegger...and Jackie Chan. This movie better have subtitles.
EVQ7xDSgtI261	This is just terrible
EVQ7xDSgtI262	Horrible CGI
EVQ7xDSgtI263	I mean I like Jackie Chan and Arnie but this movie looks like it would be better without them
EVQ7xDSgtI264	I thought Jackie was done making movies, but i'll watch it. Even if it's bad. Jackie always makes movies better when he's in them.
EVQ7xDSgtI265	Quelle grosse daube ?????
EVQ7xDSgtI266	Not sure if I should down vote because of the terrible graphics, terrible acting, terrible writing, and terrible cinematogrophy, or if I should up vote because of those.
EVQ7xDSgtI267	Oh Jackie!! I've lost all respect now. CGI looks terrible. Arnold looks and sounds ridiculous. Prediction: Early release on Sky TV - Straight to DVD - Final Destination - Garbage Disposal.
EVQ7xDSgtI268	Something is wrong... i have no charisma
EVQ7xDSgtI269	It looks like blockbuster can’t wait to see it
EVQ7xDSgtI270	Another stupid movie for gullibles.
EVQ7xDSgtI271	It looks more of a cartoon than a movie.Absolute rubbish.
EVQ7xDSgtI272	This movie looks so bad, just like all Jackie Chan movies
EVQ7xDSgtI273	Another horrible movie ruined by CGI
EVQ7xDSgtI274	Jackie Chan and Arnold,
EVQ7xDSgtI275	Hollywood's version  of Diversity.
EVQ7xDSgtI276	Kohl's will soon be selling it in their toy department.
EVQ7xDSgtI277	Terrible dialog, bad CGI, and Arnold still cant act.
