## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
a1<-read.csv("animation_duration.csv")
a2<-read.csv("comed1.csv")
a3<-read.csv("cook1.csv")
a4<-read.csv("Film&Animation.csv")
a5<-read.csv("game1.csv")
a6<-read.csv("how_to_style2009_duration.csv")
a7<-read.csv("movies_duration.csv")
a8<-read.csv("mus1.csv")
a9<-read.csv("ng1.csv")
a10<-read.csv("P&B1.csv")

a11<-read.csv("P&A1.csv")


a12<-read.csv("spor1.csv")
a13<-read.csv("travel_vlog_Dur.csv")
a<-rbind(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12,a13)
write.csv(a,"a.csv")

a <- a[a$duration < 120,]
a<-na.omit(a)



hist(a$duration,xlab = "Weight",col = "yellow",border = "blue",main=NULL)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
